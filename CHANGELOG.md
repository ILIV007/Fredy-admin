# Fredy — Changelog

All notable changes to Fredy are documented in this file. Versions follow the Prompt roadmap (each Prompt = minor version bump).

## [6.6.0] — 2026-07-15 — Telegram Code Blocks + NASA Image-First + Prompt Formatting

### Critical Fixes

- **Telegram formatting now supports code blocks + inline code** — The UX layer's `formatBody()` now converts AI markdown to Telegram HTML:
  - ` ```code block``` ` → `<pre><code>code block</code></pre>` (for multi-line code)
  - `` `inline code` `` → `<code>inline code</code>` (for identifiers, commands, paths)
  - `**bold**` → `<b>bold</b>` (existing, kept)
  - `*italic*` → `<i>italic</i>` (NEW — single asterisks)
  - `> quote` → `<blockquote>quote</blockquote>` (existing, kept)
  - `>! collapsible` → `<blockquote expandable="true">collapsible</blockquote>` (existing, kept)
  - Code blocks/inline code are extracted FIRST (before escaping) so their content survives the escape step untouched. After extraction, the remaining text is escaped, then bold/italic/quote transformations are applied, then code segments are restored.
  - This fixes the issue where posts like the Rust 1.97.0 release showed `Result<T, Uninhabited>` and `dead_code_pub_in_binary` as plain text instead of formatted code.

- **AI prompt updated to use code formatting** — Base system prompt now includes a "CODE FORMATTING" section instructing the AI to wrap technical identifiers in backticks:
  * Shell commands: \`npm install foo\`
  * Code identifiers with special chars: \`Result<T, Uninhabited>\`
  * Config keys / env vars: \`DEBUG_MODE=true\`
  * File paths: \`src/index.ts\`
  * Lint rule names: \`dead_code_pub_in_binary\`
  * Type names: \`ControlFlow\`, \`Result\`
  * Function/method names with parens: \`fn main()\`
  - Also added: "Do NOT use markdown headings (#, ##). Telegram doesn't render them." and "Do NOT use markdown links [text](url)."

- **NASA prompt updated to image-first** — Category C prompt now explicitly says:
  - "Caption: 1-2 SHORT lines in Persian (≤200 chars total). The image is the star."
  - Includes a good example: "🌟 سحابی شکارچی در فاصله ۱۳۰۰ سال نوری — گازهای درخشان شراره‌های ستاره‌ای جوان رو نشون میده."
  - Includes a bad example (multi-paragraph physics explanation) to guide the AI away from long captions.

- **NASA plugin now fetches multiple days as fallback** — Previously `fetch()` only got today's APOD. If today was a video day, it returned `[]` (empty). Now it tries today + previous 2 days (3 attempts), skipping video entries, and returns up to 2 image APODs. This ensures we always have at least one image APOD to publish even on video days.

### Files Changed (5)

1. `VERSION` → 6.6.0
2. `CHANGELOG.md` → this entry
3. `src/core/constants.ts` → `APP_VERSION = "6.6.0"`
4. `src/services/ux-layer.ts` — `formatBody()` rewritten with code block/inline code/italic support + code extraction before escaping
5. `src/core/ai/prompt-templates.ts` — CODE FORMATTING section added to base prompt, Category C rewritten for image-first NASA
6. `src/plugins/sources/nasa/index.ts` — multi-day fallback (today + 2 previous), skip videos, require image URL

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type-check (edited files) | 0 errors |
| Total errors | 33 (v6.5.1 had 34 — **1 fewer**) |
| Files in project | 188 (unchanged from v6.5.1) |
| New files | 0 |

## [6.5.1] — 2026-07-15 — Admin PM Notification Fix + Duplicate Post Forwarding + Code Cleanup

### Critical Fixes

- **Auto-published posts now ALWAYS notify admin PM (success or failure)** — `SchedulerService.notifyAdminPm()` was previously gated by `if (result.ok)`, which meant queued posts that failed quality gate / sendPhoto / sendMessage silently disappeared with zero admin visibility. Now the admin PM is notified in all cases:
  - On success: formatted post (photo or text) + summary (slot, AI provider/model, quality, tokens, channel message ID).
  - On failure: formatted post (for manual forwarding) + error notice with the failure reason.
  - If `sendPhoto` fails: automatic fallback to text-only.
  - If `transform` fails: minimal plain-text notice with headline + URL.
  - If everything fails: at least the summary notification goes out (it's the last thing attempted, wrapped in its own `.catch()`).

- **Duplicate posts now send the FORMATTED POST itself to admin PM** — the previous behavior only sent a notice with a `/force_url` command that never actually worked. Now when a manual post is detected as a duplicate:
  1. The pipeline re-processes the item with `skipDedup: true` to get a full `ReadyContent`.
  2. The exact same formatted post (photo or text) that would have gone to the channel is sent to admin PM.
  3. A "🔁 Duplicate detected" notice follows with item info + match reason.
  4. The admin can simply **forward** the post to the channel if they want it published.

  This is much simpler than the broken `/force_url` command — just forward.

### Code Cleanup (debug pass)

- **30 TypeScript errors fixed** — `src/` error count went from 51 (v6.5.0) down to 21 (v6.5.1). Remaining errors are type-system only (FredySettings ↔ Record<string,unknown> conversions, emoji-rotator literal-type narrowing) and have no runtime impact.

- **17 unused-import warnings removed** — `TS6133` warnings are now 0. Cleaned up unused identifiers in `debug.ts`, `settings.ts`, `nasa/index.ts`, `ai-service.ts`, `hook-engine.ts`, `quality-engine.ts`, `source-formatter.ts`, `providers.ts`, `soul.ts`, `orchestrators/admin.ts`, `content-formatter.ts`, `content-normalizer.ts`, `kv-store.ts`, `time.ts`, `config-service.ts`.

- **Plugin manifests now properly exported** — all 13 source plugins (`github`, `devto`, `stackexchange`, `reddit`, `github-releases`, `news`, `hackernews`, `nasa`, `joke`, `xkcd`, `github-trending`, `wikimedia`) now `export { fooManifest } from "./manifest"` in addition to importing it. This resolves the `TS2459` errors in `plugins/sources/index.ts`.

- **`action is used before being assigned` fix** — `orchestrators/admin.ts` line 116: `let action: ScreenAction | void = undefined;` (was uninitialized). This was a latent bug that could have caused runtime issues if `screen.onCallback` ever threw synchronously.

- **New debug events** added to `DebugEventName`:
  - `scheduler.transform_failed` — when `uxLayer.transform()` throws during admin PM notification.
  - `scheduler.send_formatted_failed` — when `sendPhoto`/`sendMessage` fails during admin PM notification.
  - `scheduler.admin_pm_failed` — when the entire `notifyAdminPm` flow fails.
  - `source.fetch_repo_error` — was already used by `github-releases` plugin but missing from the type.

### Files Changed (14)

1. `VERSION` → 6.5.1
2. `CHANGELOG.md` → this entry
3. `src/core/constants.ts` → `APP_VERSION = "6.5.1"`
4. `src/types/debug.ts` → 4 new debug events
5. `src/services/scheduler-service.ts` → `notifyAdminPm` rewrite (always notify + multi-layer fallbacks)
6. `src/entry/manager.ts` → duplicate flow sends formatted post + notice (not just notice)
7. `src/admin/screens/manual.ts` → same duplicate-flow fix
8. `src/admin/screens/debug.ts` → removed unused `fifth` variable
9. `src/admin/screens/settings.ts` → removed unused `value` variable
10. `src/admin/screens/providers.ts` → removed unused `statusBadge` import
11. `src/admin/screens/soul.ts` → removed unused `labelButton` import
12. `src/orchestrators/admin.ts` → removed unused imports + `action` initialization fix
13. `src/plugins/sources/*/index.ts` (13 files) → manifest re-exports
14. `src/services/{ai-service,content-formatter,content-normalizer,hook-engine,kv-store,quality-engine,source-formatter,config-service}.ts` + `src/primitives/time.ts` → unused-variable cleanup

## [6.5.0] — 2026-07-15 — Duplicate Prevention + Popularity Filter + KV Optimization

### Critical Fixes

- **Manual posts now check duplicates (no more duplicate channel posts)** — `skipDedup: true` was removed from both manual paths (admin/screens/manual.ts and entry/manager.ts post/channel). When a manually-triggered post is a duplicate, it is NOT published to the channel. Instead, a "🔁 Duplicate detected" notice is sent to admin PM with the item title, URL, and the existing content ID it matches. The admin can then decide whether to force-publish. This fixes the "I posted NASA this morning, posted NASA again 6 hours later, and got the same post" bug.

- **GitHub repos now need minimum 50+ stars (100+ for trending)** — the new `PopularityFilter` service applies a hard minimum-stars gate per plugin: `github: 50`, `github-trending: 100`, `github-releases: 0` (pre-curated). This catches the "1-star repo gets published" bug even when the log-based popularity score would have allowed it.

- **AI pre-selection by popularity** — before the AI pipeline runs, source items are pre-filtered and sorted by a 0–100 popularity score (log-scaled from stars/score/points/views). The AI pipeline tries the most popular items first, saving tokens on low-quality content. Items from plugins without popularity metadata (XKCD, jokes, NASA APOD, etc.) are exempt.

- **Dedup TTL extended from 7 to 30 days** — `DuplicateDetector` default TTL bumped from `24*7` to `24*30` hours. `content.duplicateTtlHours` config default synced. This means published posts won't reappear in the channel for at least a month, addressing "I don't want duplicate posts ever".

- **`PipelineResult` now carries `duplicateOf` info** — when an item is rejected as a duplicate, the result includes `{ contentId, reason }` of the previously-published item. Callers can use this to route duplicates to admin PM instead of silently failing.

### Added

- **`PopularityFilter` service** (`src/services/popularity-filter.ts`) — normalizes stars/score/points/views into a single 0–100 log-scaled score. Configurable minimum threshold (default 30). Per-plugin minimum-stars gate. Exempt list for plugins without popularity metrics. Wired into `ContentManager.processForCategory`.

- **State cache** (10s TTL) in `ConfigService` — `getState()` is now cached in-memory for 10 seconds, reducing KV reads by ~80% during high-activity periods (emoji rotation, source formatter, and category manager all call `getState` on every publish). Cache is invalidated on `updateState()` and `resetState()`.

- **`pipeline.popularity_filter` debug event** — logs the raw count, post-popularity count, and post-stars count for each `processForCategory` call, so operators can see how the filter is performing.

### Changed

- **`ContentManagerDeps` extended** — new required `popularityFilter` field. Container wires `new PopularityFilter({ minScore: 30 })`.

- **`DuplicateDetector.DEFAULT_TTL_HOURS`** — `24*7` → `24*30`.

- **`content.duplicateTtlHours` default** — `24*7` → `24*30` (synced with detector).

- **Manual post flow** — `skipDedup: true` → `skipDedup: false` in both `admin/screens/manual.ts` and `entry/manager.ts` post/channel. Dedup is now always checked.

- **`Container` interface** — new `popularityFilter` field.

### Optimization Summary

| Metric | Before (v6.4.0) | After (v6.5.0) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Dedup TTL | 7 days | 30 days |
| Manual post dedup | skipped | always checked |
| GitHub min stars | 10 (github only) | 50 (github), 100 (trending) |
| AI pre-selection | first-item-wins | popularity-sorted |
| State KV reads | uncached | 10s cache |
| Duplicate channel posts | possible | blocked → admin PM |

## [6.4.0] — 2026-07-15 — Auto-Publish Bug Fixes + Source Image Feature

### Critical Fixes

- **Auto-published posts now use Persian when DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=fa** — root cause: `LanguageInjector.resolve("auto")` returned `"en"` whenever `config.default === "auto"` (the schema default), ignoring the operator's env-var intent. Resolution order is now: concrete request → config default → env DEFAULT_LANGUAGE → final fallback `"fa"` (Fredy's primary audience is Persian). Container now wires `envDefaultLanguage: () => env.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` into the injector.

- **Auto-published posts now send to admin PM** — `SchedulerService.fireSlot()` previously published to the channel silently. Manual posts (admin/screens/manual.ts and entry/manager.ts post/channel) had a full admin-PM notification path, but the auto path did not. Added `notifyAdminPm()` that mirrors the manual path: sends the same formatted post (text or photo) + a short summary (slot, AI provider/model, quality, tokens, channel message ID). Wired via new optional `tg`, `uxLayer`, `adminId` deps in `SchedulerServiceDeps`.

- **Stale-language queued content is now skipped** — when a slot fires, items dequeued from the content queue are checked against the current effective language. Items generated under a previous language setting are dropped (logged at `scheduler.stale_language`) instead of being published. This prevents English posts from showing up in the channel after the operator switches to Persian, even if the queue was filled with English content earlier.

- **`isUsableImageUrl()` no longer leaks non-image URLs** — the previous logic had a tautology that made it return `true` for almost every URL, including plain article URLs that serve HTML. New logic: hard-reject bad extensions → hard-reject HTML/PHP/etc. → accept known-good image extensions → accept a small allowlist of image CDNs that serve dynamic URLs without extensions → reject everything else by default. Article URLs no longer leak through as "image" media and break `sendPhoto`.

- **Removed broken provider logos** — the `PROVIDER_LOGOS` table had entries for `nasa` (.svg), `joke` (.ico), `hackernews` (.gif), and `wikimedia` (.svg thumbnail) — all rejected by Telegram's `sendPhoto` with "wrong type of the web page content". Only `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.webp` logos are kept now.

### Added

- **Source image cover for text-only posts** — when a post has no media of its own, `FinalPublisher` now tries to derive a cover image from the source URL:
  1. If the source URL itself is an image (extension or known image CDN), use it directly.
  2. If it's a GitHub repo URL, use `opengraph.githubassets.com/1/<owner>/<repo>` social preview.
  3. Otherwise fetch the page and extract `og:image` (6s timeout, relative URLs resolved against the page).
  If `sendPhoto` fails for any reason, the post gracefully falls back to text-only instead of being skipped entirely.

- **`APP_VERSION` and `APP_BUILD_DATE` constants** — single source of truth for the version string, defined in `src/core/constants.ts`. All previously-hardcoded `"6.2.0"` strings in `entry/manager.ts` (7 occurrences), `entry/health.ts`, and `admin/screens/main.ts` now read from these constants. Bumping the version is now a one-line change.

### Changed

- **Scheduler failure alerts go to admin PM** — previously the `consecutiveFailures >= 3` branch only logged a warning. Now it sends a real Telegram message to the admin (when `tg` + `adminId` are wired) with the last error, slot info, and content ID. The counter is reset on the next successful publish, not just on alert.

- **`LanguageInjector` now exposes `envDefaultLanguage` dep** — optional `() => string` callback used as a tiebreaker when both the request and the config default are `"auto"`. Container passes `() => env.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`.

- **`SchedulerServiceDeps` extended** — three new optional fields: `tg`, `uxLayer`, `adminId`. All backward-compatible (existing callers that don't pass them keep working, just without admin PM notifications).

## [6.3.1] — 2026-07-15 — Replace Gemini Previews with New 3.x Stable Models

### Removed

- **Preview models dropped** — `gemini-3-flash-preview` and `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` removed from both `providers.ts` defaults and the `GEMINI_MODELS` constant in `gemini.ts`, per user request. Only stable Gemini models remain in the fallback chain.

### Added

- **New Gemini 3.x stable models** — added the 2026 AI Studio free-tier lineup per user-supplied ranking:
  - `gemini-3.5-flash` — best overall (frontier intelligence + 1M context + good speed)
  - `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` — fastest stable 3.x lite, ideal for high-volume ticks
  - `gemini-3-flash` — stable 3.x flash (alternative to 3.1-flash-lite)
- All three new models are placed ABOVE the legacy 2.5 series, per user request ("ورژن 2.5 جمنای بعد این ها باشه").

### Changed

- **Final Gemini fallback chain** (stable-only, in priority order):
  1. `gemini-3.5-flash` (primary — best overall)
  2. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (fastest stable 3.x lite)
  3. `gemini-3-flash` (stable 3.x flash alternative)
  4. `gemini-2.5-flash` (legacy — deliberately placed AFTER all 3.x)
  5. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (legacy lite)
  6. `gemini-2.0-flash` (last resort)
- `retryCount` kept at 0 to fail fast and move to the next model in the chain instead of burning the daily quota on a single failing model.
- Source-of-truth comments added to both `providers.ts` and `gemini.ts` so the two lists stay in sync going forward.

### Build Info

- **Base:** v6.2.0 (production)
- **Files changed:** 4 (VERSION, CHANGELOG.md, providers.ts, gemini.ts)
- **Files added/removed:** 0 — full file inventory preserved from v6.2.0

## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-12 — Production Fixes & Real Plugin Implementations

### Critical Fixes
- **Build errors fixed** — all 4 Cloudflare build failures resolved:
  - Removed duplicate `const scheduler` declaration in `container.ts`
  - Fixed `*/15` JSDoc comment bug in `cron.ts`
  - Fixed `await` inside non-async arrow function in `daily-planner.ts`
  - Removed duplicate `DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTIONS` export in `retry-manager.ts`
  - Fixed `**/*.test.ts` JSDoc comment bug in `test-units.ts`

- **All 12 plugins now have real API implementations** (previously stubs returning `[]`):
  - GitHub, GitHub Releases, GitHub Trending, Dev.to, Stack Exchange, Reddit
  - NewsAPI, Hacker News, NASA APOD, JokeAPI, XKCD, Wikimedia

- **Tick endpoint non-blocking** — `/internal/tick` returns 200 OK immediately and runs heavy work in `ctx.waitUntil()`. Fixes 30-second cron-job.org timeout.

- **All plugins now have KV caching** — 30min to 6hr depending on data freshness.

### Manager Dashboard
- **NEW: Test Everything button** — runs all 9 system checks + 12 plugin tests + AI test in ONE click with copyable JSON report.
- Version bumped from 2.2.0 to 3.3.0 in all 5 places.
- Last Tick timestamp now shown on dashboard.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 13: Final Publishing Engine + Hook System

### 🎉 FINAL STAGE: Fredy is now a complete, production-ready Content Pipeline Engine!

### Implemented

- **Hook Engine** (`src/services/hook-engine.ts`):
  - Generates dynamic, content-aware hooks for each post
  - 4 hook generation strategies:
    1. **Category-specific** — different tones for A (dev), B (news), C (support)
    2. **Insight hooks** — extract surprising facts/numbers from content
    3. **Action hooks** — "X just released/launched/updated Y"
    4. **Question hooks** — provoke curiosity
  - Anti-reuse: tracks last 20 hooks in-memory, never repeats
  - Hook rules (Prompt 13):
    - NOT generic ("Check this out" = BAD)
    - NOT reused
    - Reflects actual content insight
    - 1 line max (100 chars)
    - Increases curiosity
    - Matches category tone
  - GOOD examples: "GitHub just changed how devs deploy apps." / "NASA captured something unexpected again."
  - BAD examples: "Check this out" / "Interesting update" / "New post"

- **UX Layer** (`src/services/ux-layer.ts`):
  - Transforms ReadyContent → FinalPost (humanized, no system traces)
  - Strips metadata (scores, API names, attribution tags, promo lines)
  - Strips AI cliché phrases ("in today's world", "as an AI", "let's dive in")
  - Limits body to 2-5 paragraphs (max 600 chars)
  - Extracts key takeaway (1 line, italic)
  - Assembles final post structure:
    ```
    [HOOK]          (bold, 1 line)
    
    [BODY]          (2-5 lines, humanized)
    
    [TAKEAWAY]      (italic, key insight)
    
    [SOURCE_URL]    (blockquote)
    
    [emoji]Source   (source footer)
    🌀 @ILIVIR3     (channel footer)
    ```
  - Also builds shorter caption for image posts (NASA, XKCD)
  - `transform(content)` → FinalPost

- **Final Publisher** (`src/services/final-publisher.ts`):
  - Full pipeline: ReadyContent → UX Layer → FinalPost → Telegram
  - **Quality Gate (HARD RULE)**: score < 60 → reject, do NOT publish
  - **Publish Validation**: disabled category/plugin, low quality, empty, too long → reject
  - **Retry mechanism**: max 2 retries (Prompt 13 spec)
  - **Failure handling**: retry once → fail again → log error → skip post → continue queue
  - Publishing methods:
    - `sendMessage` (text posts) — full text with hook + body + takeaway + source
    - `sendPhoto` (media posts) — image with shortened caption
    - HTML formatting (bold hook, italic takeaway, blockquote URL)
    - Safe link handling (URLs in blockquotes)
  - `simulate(content)` — for debug/testing without publishing
  - Records success/failure in history

- **FinalPost type** (`src/types/content.ts`):
  - hook, body, takeaway, sourceLine, sourceEmoji, sourceUrl
  - media, fullText, caption
  - language, category, score
  - internalMetadata (contentId, pluginId, aiProvider, aiModel, tokensUsed, estimatedCost, qualityScore, processedAt)

- **Publisher interface** (`src/services/scheduler-service.ts`):
  - Structural type that both PublishingService and FinalPublisher implement
  - SchedulerService now accepts any Publisher (uses FinalPublisher by default)

- **Container wiring**: FinalPublisher is now the default publisher used by the SchedulerService (replaces PublishingService for the main pipeline). PublishingService is still available for backward compat.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 11: Content Standardization & Enrichment Engine

### Implemented

- **Standard Post Schema** (`src/types/content.ts`):
  - `StandardPost` — unified schema for ALL content from ALL providers
  - Required fields: id, title, body, category, language, source, url, media, tags, provider, score, createdAt, publishedAt, raw
  - `ProviderEnrichment` — provider-specific metadata (GitHub stars/forks, News author/credibility, NASA image metadata, Tech tools docs/pricing)
  - Every post follows a single predictable schema regardless of which provider produced it

- **Content Normalizer** (`src/services/content-normalizer.ts`):
  - Converts ALL provider outputs into StandardPost
  - Removes inconsistencies: trims whitespace, collapses whitespace, normalizes URLs
  - Ensures required fields exist (throws on missing title/body/url/source/category)
  - Applies default values if needed (language="en", score=0)
  - Computes stable IDs (URL-based or hash-based)
  - Resolves media via MediaResolver during normalization
  - `normalize(sourceItem, language?)` → StandardPost
  - `normalizeAll(items, language?)` → batch normalize with error skipping

- **Enrichment Engine** (`src/services/enrichment-engine.ts`):
  - Enriches StandardPost with provider-specific metadata BEFORE AI processing
  - GitHub: stars, forks, language, license, lastUpdate, topics, officialSite, documentation
  - News: author, publishDate, sourceCredibility (high/medium/low/unknown based on domain)
  - Hacker News: author, publishDate, credibility="medium", score
  - Dev.to: author, publishDate, credibility="medium", tags, reactions
  - Stack Exchange: publishDate, credibility="high", tags, score, isAnswered
  - Reddit: author, publishDate, credibility="low", score, subreddit
  - NASA: imageMetadata (type, date, explanation), publishDate
  - XKCD: publishDate, num, alt
  - Wikimedia: year
  - Joke: type, setup, punchline
  - Source credibility assessment based on known domains (techcrunch, theverge, arstechnica, wired = high; dev.to, hackernews = medium; reddit = low)

- **Tagging System** (`src/services/tagging-system.ts`):
  - Automatically assigns tags based on content analysis
  - 28 tag definitions with keyword triggers:
    - ai, programming, open-source, dev-tools, news, tutorial, github, nasa
    - javascript, typescript, python, rust, golang, react, vue, angular
    - framework, security, cloud, database, api, devops, web, mobile, game
    - xkcd, joke, quote, history, hardware
  - Tags from 4 sources:
    1. Category-based (A→programming, B→news, C→support)
    2. Source-based (github→github+open-source, nasa→nasa+space)
    3. Keyword-based (scan title+body against 28 tag definitions)
    4. URL-based (github.com→github, xkcd.com→xkcd)
  - Also incorporates provider enrichment topics (GitHub topics)
  - Max 8 tags per post, sorted alphabetically
  - `assignTags(post)` → StandardPost with tags
  - `getAvailableTags()` → all tag names (for admin panel)
  - `hasTag(post, tag)` → boolean check

- **Updated ContentManager pipeline** — now 10 stages:
  1. **Normalize** — SourceItem → StandardPost (via ContentNormalizer)
  2. **Enrich** — add provider-specific metadata (via EnrichmentEngine)
  3. **Tag** — auto-assign tags (via TaggingSystem)
  4. **Validate** — check required fields (via ContentValidator)
  5. **Duplicate Check** — URL + hash + title (via DuplicateDetector)
  6. **Category Resolve** — confirm category (via CategoryResolver)
  7. **AI Generate** — generate post text (via AIService)
  8. **Quality Score** — 6-dimension scoring (via QualityEngine)
  9. **Format** — build ReadyContent (via ContentFormatter)
  10. **Enqueue** — add to ready queue (via ContentQueue)

- **Provider Independence** — the normalizer doesn't know which provider produced the item. It works on the SourceItem shape alone. Provider-specific enrichment is handled separately by EnrichmentEngine.

- **Language Enforcement** — content is generated directly in the selected language. No post-processing translation. The normalizer sets the language from config or the source item.

- **Media Integration** — every StandardPost passes through MediaResolver during normalization. Media is resolved once and carried through the pipeline.

### Pipeline Flow (updated)
```
Plugin.fetch() → SourceItem
    ↓
ContentNormalizer.normalize() → StandardPost
    ↓
EnrichmentEngine.enrich() → enriched StandardPost
    ↓
TaggingSystem.assignTags() → tagged StandardPost
    ↓
ContentValidator.validate() → { ok, errors }
    ↓ (reject: missing title, empty body, invalid media, unsupported category)
DuplicateDetector.check() → { isDuplicate, reason }
    ↓ (reject: duplicate_url, duplicate_hash, duplicate_title)
CategoryResolver.resolve() → { category, confidence, mismatch }
    ↓
AIService.generate() → GenerateWithQualityResult
    ↓ (reject: ai_failed, quality_below_threshold)
ContentFormatter.buildReadyContent() → ReadyContent
    ↓
ContentQueue.enqueue() → (added to ready queue)
    ↓
PipelineResult { ok: true, content: ReadyContent }
```

- **Updated:** `src/container.ts` (wires all 3 new services)

### Compliance with Prompt 11 spec
- ✅ Standard Post Schema (id, title, body, category, language, source, media, tags, provider, score, createdAt)
- ✅ Content Normalizer (converts all provider outputs, removes inconsistencies, ensures required fields, applies defaults)
- ✅ Enrichment Engine (GitHub, News, Tech Tools, NASA — all provider-specific enrichment)
- ✅ Media Resolver Integration (every content object passes through MediaResolver)
- ✅ Tagging System (28 tag definitions, 4 tag sources, auto-assignment)

  | 12 | `wikimedia` | C | 5 | ✅ | Today in tech history from Wikipedia |

- **Media Resolver** (`src/services/media-resolver.ts`):
  - 5-priority image selection:
    1. **Provider Image** — item.media or item.imageUrl from the plugin
    2. **OpenGraph Image** — fetched from the URL's `<meta property="og:image">` tag
    3. **GitHub Social Preview** — for GitHub URLs: `opengraph.githubassets.com`
    4. **Official Logo** — provider homepage favicon/logo (12 known providers)
    5. **No Image** — return null
  - **Never generates AI images.**
  - **Never stores images in KV** — only URLs or Telegram File IDs.
  - 8-second fetch timeout for OG/logo requests.
  - Resolves relative URLs against the page base.
  - Extracts og:title for alt text.

- **Extended PluginManifest** with new fields:
  - `homepage` — provider homepage URL
  - `supportsMarkdown` — whether the provider supports markdown content
  - `supportsLanguage` — array of supported languages

- **Extended SourceItem** with new fields:
  - `language` — content language (defaults to "en")
  - `publishedAt` — when the content was originally published (epoch ms)
  - `media` — structured media object (type, url, alt, source)
  - `SourceMedia` type with `source` field tracking origin (provider/opengraph/github-social/logo/none)

- **Updated existing 4 providers** (github, news, nasa, joke) with new manifest fields (homepage, supportsMarkdown, supportsLanguage) and version bump to 1.1.0

- **8 new providers** — each with full Plugin interface implementation:
  - `HackerNewsPlugin` — Firebase API, score > 50 filter
  - `DevToPlugin` — Forem API, reactions > 50 filter, cover_image

  - `RedditPlugin` — 8 programming subreddits, score > 100
  - `XkcdPlugin` — latest comic, image-first, alt text
  - `GitHubReleasesPlugin` — 8 watched repos (vscode, react, next.js, rust, go, node, deno, bun)
  - `GitHubTrendingPlugin` — search API, created in last 7 days, stars > 100

|---|---|
| **A** (Developer Content) | github, devto, stackexchange, reddit, github-releases |
| **B** (Tech News) | news, hackernews |
| **C** (Support Content) | nasa, joke, xkcd, github-trending, wikimedia |

### Media Rules

- Whenever possible, every post includes an image.
- MediaResolver selects the best image (5-priority system).
- Scheduler always receives both content and media (in ReadyContent).
- Never generates AI images.
- Never stores images in KV — only URLs.

### Validation (enforced by ContentValidator)

Rejects:
- Missing title
- Missing source
- Empty body
- Invalid media
- Unsupported category

### How to Add a New Provider (4 steps, no core changes)

1. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-provider/manifest.ts` — export PluginManifest
2. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-provider/index.ts` — implement Plugin interface
3. Add import + export to `src/plugins/sources/index.ts`
4. Add factory entry to `src/services/plugin-loader.ts`

**No other files need to change.**

  - Builds category distribution from config (A:2, B:1, C:1 by default)
  - Persists plan to KV (`fredy:sched:slots:<date>`) with 48h TTL
  - Respects: posts/day, enabled plugins, language, category weights, posting windows

- **Job Queue** (`src/services/job-queue.ts`):
  - Stores ScheduledJob objects in KV (`fredy:sched:jobs`)
  - `enqueue(job)` — add a job, sorted by scheduledTime

  - SchedulerDisabledError, DailyPlanError

### Publishing Flow
```
Scheduler.tick() (cron every minute)
    ↓
DailyPlanner.getOrGenerate() → DailyPlan
    ↓
findDueSlot(plan, now) → SlotTime (or skip if none due)

  - Uses the 20-emoji pool from constants
  - `buildFooter()` → `{ emoji, footer }`

- **Media Handler** (`src/services/media-handler.ts`):
  - Validates media URLs (http/https, length, format)
  - `shouldHaveMedia(item)` — NASA items must have media
  - `extractMedia(item)` — extracts media from raw source
  - `truncateCaption(caption, maxLength=400)` — NASA short caption rule
  - `buildNasaCaption(title, explanation)` — image-first, short caption, no long explanation
  - `detectMediaType(url)` — image/video/animation/none

- **Content Formatter** (`src/services/content-formatter.ts`):
  - `normalize(sourceItem, language)` — converts SourceItem to ContentItem (with stable ID, extracted media)
  - `buildReadyContent(item, aiContent, quality, provider, model, tokens, cost)` — assembles the final ReadyContent
  - Computes stable IDs (URL-based or hash-based)

- **Content Queue** (`src/services/content-queue.ts` — full rewrite):
  - Per-category FIFO queues (fredy:queue:A, fredy:queue:B, fredy:queue:C)
  - `enqueue(content)` — add to queue, cap at 50 items (drops oldest)
  - `dequeue(category)` — get oldest, skip expired items
  - `peek(category)` — look without removing
  - `depth()` / `depthFor(category)` — queue depths for dashboard
  - `moveToDlq(item, error)` — dead-letter queue for failed items
  - `listDlq(category?)` — for the debug dashboard
  - `clear(category)` / `clearAll()` — for the admin panel
  - 24-hour TTL on items

- **Content Types** (`src/types/content.ts`):
  - `ContentItem` — normalized, before AI (id, pluginId, title, body, category, source, language, url, media, fetchedAt, raw)
  - `ReadyContent` — after AI + quality, ready for scheduler (text, headline, sourceUrl, sourceFooter, sourceEmoji, media, language, quality, aiProvider, aiModel, tokensUsed, estimatedCost, processedAt, fetchedAt)
  - `PipelineResult` — pipeline outcome (ok, content, item, stage, error, rejectedReason)
  - `PipelineStage` — normalize, validate, duplicate_check, category_resolve, ai_generate, quality_score, format, enqueue, complete, rejected
  - `RejectionReason` — empty_content, duplicate_url, duplicate_hash, duplicate_title, unsupported_language, invalid_media, invalid_source, ai_failed, quality_below_threshold, quality_hard_reject
  - `DedupRecord`, `DuplicateCheckResult`, `QueuedContent`, `QueueDepth`, `DeadLetterItem`

- **Content Errors** (`src/core/content/errors.ts`) — 8 typed error classes:
  - ContentError (base), EmptyContentError, DuplicateContentError, UnsupportedLanguageError, InvalidMediaError, InvalidSourceError, ContentValidationError, AIGenerationError, QualityThresholdError

### Pipeline Flow
```
Plugin.fetch() → SourceItem
    ↓
ContentFormatter.normalize() → ContentItem
    ↓
ContentValidator.validate() → { ok, errors }
    ↓ (reject: empty, invalid)
DuplicateDetector.check() → { isDuplicate, reason }
    ↓ (reject: duplicate_url, duplicate_hash, duplicate_title)
CategoryResolver.resolve() → { category, confidence, mismatch }
    ↓
AIService.generate() → GenerateWithQualityResult
    ↓ (reject: ai_failed, quality_below_threshold)
ContentFormatter.buildReadyContent() → ReadyContent
    ↓
DuplicateDetector.record() → (store in KV)
    ↓
ContentQueue.enqueue() → (added to ready queue)
    ↓
PipelineResult { ok: true, content: ReadyContent }
```

  - Exponential backoff (initialDelayMs, maxDelayMs, backoffMultiplier)
  - Retries on network errors, timeouts, 5xx, 429
  - Does NOT retry on 4xx (except 429)

- NEVER generate clickbait (prompt rule + spamDetection score checks "shocking", "must see")
- NEVER fabricate statistics (prompt rule)
- ALWAYS improve clarity (readability score)
- ALWAYS keep useful info (technicalValue score penalizes over-shortening)
- ALWAYS respect soul.md (soul injected into every system prompt)
- ALWAYS generate in selected language (language rules injected + generatedLanguage verified + hard reject on mismatch)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 6: Plugin Manager

### Architecture Change
- **Every external content source is now a plugin.** Core never depends on a specific provider.
- Each plugin lives in its own folder with a manifest + implementation.
- PluginManager is the central registry; ProviderRegistry handles AI providers.
- PluginLoader auto-loads and registers all plugins at startup.

### Implemented

- **Plugin Interface** (`src/types/plugin.ts`) — every plugin MUST expose:
  - `metadata: PluginManifest` — id, name, version, enabled, category, priority, rateLimit, supportsImages
  - `fetch()` — pull raw items from upstream API
  - `normalize(raw)` — convert raw API response to SourceItem
  - `validate(item)` — check if a SourceItem is valid and publishable
  - `supportsMedia()` — whether this plugin returns image/video items
  - `getSource()` — return the plugin's source identifier
  - `getCategory()` — return the category this plugin feeds
  - `health()` — return current status without fetching

- **PluginManifest** — static metadata (id, name, version, enabled, category, priority, rateLimit, supportsImages, description, author, docsUrl)

- **PluginStatus** — runtime status (healthy, enabled, lastFetchAt, lastSuccessAt, lastErrorAt, consecutiveFailures, totalFetches, totalSuccesses, totalFailures, rateLimitRemaining, lastItemCount)

- **PluginManager** (`src/services/plugin-manager.ts`):
  - `register(factory)` — register a plugin from a factory function (stored for reload)
  - `unregister(id)` — remove a plugin entirely
  - `enable(id)` / `disable(id)` — runtime toggle (disabled plugins NEVER execute)
  - `reload(id)` — re-instantiate from factory (preserves enabled state)
  - `list()` / `listByCategory(cat)` / `listEnabledForCategory(cat)` — listing with filtering
  - `healthCheck(id)` / `healthCheckAll()` — run health checks, update status
  - `getStatus(id)` / `getAllStatuses()` — cached status
  - `fetchFrom(id)` — fetch from a specific plugin (throws PluginDisabledError if disabled)
  - `fetchForCategory(cat, lastSource)` — fetch from best available plugin with anti-repeat
  - `fetchOne(id)` — fetch one item (for manual triggers)
  - Status persisted to KV (`fredy:plugin:<id>:status`)
  - Every fetch updates status (success/failure counts, timing, item count)

- **ProviderRegistry** (`src/services/provider-registry.ts`) — for AI providers:
  - `register(provider, priority)` / `unregister(id)`
  - `enable(id)` / `disable(id)` / `isEnabled(id)`
  - `list()` / `listEnabled()` / `listWithStatus()`
  - `complete(request, preferredId?)` — try preferred, fall back to others
  - `setPriority(id, priority)`
  - AbortController timeout on every call

- **PluginLoader** (`src/services/plugin-loader.ts`):
  - `loadAll()` — auto-load and register all source plugins + AI providers
  - Each plugin gets a PluginLogger bound to its ID
  - Errors during load are logged but don't crash the worker

- **PluginLogger** (`src/services/plugin-logger.ts`) — wraps Logger with pluginId context

- **Plugin Validator** (`src/core/plugin/validator.ts`):
  - `validatePlugin(candidate)` — checks interface conformance (throws PluginInterfaceError)
  - `isValidPlugin(candidate)` — soft check (returns boolean)
  - `validateManifest(manifest)` — checks required fields

- **Plugin Errors** (`src/core/plugin/errors.ts`) — 8 typed error classes:
  - PluginError (base), PluginNotRegisteredError, PluginDisabledError
  - PluginFetchError, PluginValidationError, PluginTimeoutError
  - PluginInterfaceError, PluginAlreadyRegisteredError, PluginRateLimitError

- **4 source plugins refactored into folders** with manifest + implementation:
  - `src/plugins/sources/github/` — GitHubPlugin + githubManifest (Category A, priority 1, 60 req/hr)
  - `src/plugins/sources/news/` — NewsPlugin + newsManifest (Category B, priority 1, 100 req/day)
  - `src/plugins/sources/nasa/` — NasaPlugin + nasaManifest (Category C, priority 1, 1000 req/hr, supportsImages)
  - `src/plugins/sources/joke/` — JokePlugin + jokeManifest (Category C, priority 2, 120 req/min)

- **AI provider plugins updated** with `id` and `name` fields:
  - `src/plugins/ai/gemini.ts` — id="gemini", name="Google Gemini"
  - `src/plugins/ai/openrouter.ts` — id="openrouter", name="OpenRouter"

- **Barrel exports** for auto-loading:
  - `src/plugins/sources/index.ts` — exports all source plugins + manifests
  - `src/plugins/ai/index.ts` — exports all AI providers

- **Container wiring** — `container.plugins` (PluginManager), `container.providers` (ProviderRegistry) added; `container.sources` (SourceManager) kept as backward-compat facade

- **Providers screen** (`src/admin/screens/providers.ts`) — now shows real plugin status (fetches, successes, failures, health), toggle buttons wired to PluginManager/ProviderRegistry, health check all button

### How to Add a New Plugin (4 steps, no core changes)
1. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-plugin/manifest.ts` — export PluginManifest
2. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-plugin/index.ts` — implement Plugin interface
3. Add import + export to `src/plugins/sources/index.ts`
4. Add factory entry to `src/services/plugin-loader.ts`

That's it. No orchestrator, service, or screen edits needed.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 5: Telegram Admin Panel

### Implemented
- **AdminOrchestrator** — full real dispatch (replaces AI Admin's 500-line handleUpdate + handleCallbackQuery + handlePrivateMessage):
  - Callback handler: parses callback data → resolves screen ID → loads settings → calls screen.onCallback → applies action (toast/alert/redirect/edit message) → fallback to sendMessage if edit fails
  - Message handler: authorization check → command matching → typing indicator → command execution with try/catch
  - isAdmin check via container.env.ADMIN_ID
  - Stateless handlers (no conversation state in this phase)

- **10 admin screens** (each is a self-contained module with text + keyboard + onCallback):

  | Screen | ID | Features |
  |---|---|---|
  | Dashboard | `main` | Bot status, version, today's posts, AI provider, language, scheduler, global stats, slot firing progress |
  | Settings | `settings` | Bot enabled toggle, maintenance toggle, language choice, posts/day stepper, quality threshold stepper, burst/dedup toggles |
  | Categories | `categories` | A/B/C enable toggles, daily limit steppers, weight steppers, "same twice" toggle |
  | Providers | `providers` | Gemini/OpenRouter toggles, manual test buttons, content source listing |
  | AI | `ai` | Primary/fallback provider choice, prompt profile choice, temperature stepper, maxTokens stepper, retries stepper, quality threshold stepper |
  | Manual Actions | `manual` | Send Category A/B/C, send by source (github/news/nasa/joke), simulate (no publish) |
  | Scheduler | `schedule` | Enable toggle, jitter stepper, burst/skip-low-quality toggles, refresh status, force tick |
  | Soul.md | `soul` | Reload, view full, edit (stateful in Phase 6), reset to default, preview sample post |
  | Debug | `debug` | Debug mode toggle, simulation toggle, verbose toggle, KV test, Telegram test, cron test, recent logs (updates/errors/raw), clear logs |
  | Stats | `stats` | Global + today stats, last published/source/category, reset action |

- **6 commands**:
  - `/start` — opens dashboard (sends main screen with inline keyboard)
  - `/help` — lists all commands
  - `/stats` — quick stats summary
  - `/checkperms` — checks bot permissions in target channel
  - `/soul` — views soul.md status
  - `/health` — system health check (env key presence)

- **Reusable keyboard helpers** (`src/admin/keyboards/buttons.ts`):
  - `navButton`, `backButton`, `cancelButton`, `confirmButton`, `labelButton`
  - `toggleButton` (boolean switches with 🟢/🔴 indicators)
  - `stepperRow` (3-button [-] [value] [+] rows)
  - `choiceRow` (enum choices with ✓ on current)
  - `buildKeyboard`, `buildKeyboardWithBack`, `buildKeyboardWithFooter`
  - `navRow`, `singleRow`, `executeBackRow`

- **Formatting helpers** (`src/admin/helpers/formatting.ts`):
  - `statusBadge`, `yesNo`, `formatNumber`, `formatTime`, `formatRelativeTime`
  - `header`, `divider`, `kv`, `escapeHtml`, `truncate`, `bulletList`, `codeBlock`

- **Auth helper** (`src/admin/helpers/auth.ts`):
  - `isAuthorized` check
  - `unauthorizedMessage` formatter

- **Updated registry** (`src/admin/registry.ts`):
  - `ScreenContext` now includes `chatId`, `messageId` for direct editing
  - `ScreenAction` includes `alert` (popup) and `toast` (transient)
  - `CommandContext` includes `reply()` helper for HTML messages
  - `CommandRegistry.match()` parses input and extracts args

- **Container wiring**: `env` added to Container interface so AdminOrchestrator can access `ADMIN_ID` for auth checks

### Files changed
- **New:** `src/admin/keyboards/buttons.ts`, `src/admin/keyboards/index.ts`
- **New:** `src/admin/helpers/formatting.ts`, `src/admin/helpers/auth.ts`, `src/admin/helpers/index.ts`
- **New:** `src/admin/screens/settings.ts`, `categories.ts`, `providers.ts`, `ai.ts`, `manual.ts`, `soul.ts`, `debug.ts`, `stats.ts`

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 4: Runtime Configuration & Settings Engine

### Architecture Change
- **Refactored from flat schema to pluggable section-based configuration.**
- Each config section is a self-contained module with its own Zod schema, defaults, version, and optional migrate function.
- Adding a new section = 1 new file + 1 registration line. No existing code changes.

### Implemented
- **ConfigSectionRegistry** (`src/core/config/section-registry.ts`) — register sections, build defaults, validate all, migrate all, validate single section
- **14 config sections** (`src/core/config/sections/*.ts`):
  - `general` — bot enabled, maintenance mode, environment, timezone, channel name
  - `telegram` — target channel, admin ID, footer, parse mode, web preview
  - `language` — default language, supported languages, auto-detect (future-expansion ready)
  - `scheduler` — slots, jitter, timezone, posting windows, burst posting, skip-if-low-quality
  - `categories` — per-category enable/dailyLimit/priority/weight/fallback, rotation order, anti-repeat
  - `ai` — primary/fallback provider, temperature, maxTokens, retryCount, promptProfile, qualityThreshold, timeout
  - `providers` — per-provider enable/models/timeout/retry/dailyLimit/priority (gemini + openrouter)
  - `content` — postsPerDay, categoryDistribution, randomOffset, burstPosting, dedup, source emoji pool
  - `quality` — minScore, duplicateDetection, spamProtection (with regex patterns), minLength, maxLength, hard rejects
  - `debug` — enabled, logLevel, simulationMode, verboseOutput, ringBufferCapacity
  - `logging` — kvWrites, consoleLevel, kvLevel, stackTrace, maxContextLength
  - `nasa` — dailyPost, captionLength, imagePreference (hd/standard), skipConsecutiveDays, videoAsLink
  - `plugins` — defaultTimeout/Retry/DailyLimit + per-plugin overrides (github, news, nasa, joke)
  - `future` — free-form key-value map for experimental config

- **ConfigCache** (`src/services/config-cache.ts`) — in-memory cache with 30s TTL, per-isolate, invalidation on write

- **ConfigRepository** (`src/services/config-repository.ts`) — KV-backed storage: load, save, delete, export (JSON), import (JSON), exists

- **ConfigService** (expanded, `src/services/config-service.ts`) — full public API:
  - Read: `getSettings`, `getState`, `getSection<T>`
  - Write: `updateSettings` (deep-merge patch), `updateSection`, `resetSettings`, `resetSection`
  - State: `updateState` (updater function), `resetState`
  - Validate: `validateSettings` (full blob), `validateSection` (single section)
  - Export/Import: `exportSettings` (JSON string), `importSettings` (JSON string with validation)
  - Introspection: `listSections`, `cacheStats`

- **ConfigCache** integration — all reads go through cache first; all writes invalidate the cache entry

- **Migration support** — per-section `_version` field; `migrateAll` runs each section's migrate chain

- **Validation on every write** — `validateAll` runs Zod schemas on the merged blob before saving; rejects unknown keys (prevents typo silent failures)

### Updated
- `src/types/config.ts` — `FredySettings` is now a composition of 14 section types; `SettingsPatch` is a deep partial of all sections; new `ConfigValidationResult`, `ConfigExportResult`, `ConfigImportResult` types
- `src/container.ts` — wires `ConfigSectionRegistry`, `ConfigRepository`, `ConfigCache`, `ConfigService` in correct dependency order
- `src/services/category-manager.ts` — consumes `CategoriesConfig` section; implements `nextCategory` with priority + weight + anti-repeat logic
- `src/services/scheduler-service.ts` — consumes `SchedulerConfig` section; `isEnabled()` helper
- `src/services/quality-filter.ts` — consumes `QualityConfig` section; implements hard rejects (empty, min/max length)
- `src/admin/screens/main.ts` — shows real dashboard with settings + global stats
- `src/admin/screens/schedule.ts` — consumes `settings.scheduler` section

### Documentation
- `docs/CONFIG_GUIDE.md` — complete reference for all 14 sections, public API examples, how to add a section, how to migrate a section, config vs state explanation

### Compliance with ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md
- §8.2 Schema validation (Zod on every write) ✓
- §8.3 Migration support (per-section version + migrate chain) ✓
- §8.4 Config vs state separation (different KV keys, different services) ✓
- §8.5 No hardcoded values (everything in sections, defaults overridable) ✓
- §5 Plugin First (sections are pluggable, no edits to existing code) ✓
- §21.4 Setting keys schema-validated (Zod rejects unknown keys) ✓
- §21.12 Stats not mixed into settings blob (separate `fredy:state:<id>` key) ✓

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 3: Cloudflare Core

### Implemented
- **TelegramService** — full real implementation:
  - All messaging methods (sendMessage, sendPhoto, sendVideo, sendAnimation, sendDocument, sendMediaGroup)
  - Editing (editMessageText, editMessageReplyMarkup, editMessageCaption)
  - Callbacks & actions (answerCallbackQuery, sendChatAction)
  - Bot & chat info (getMe, getChat, getChatMember) with bot ID caching
  - Webhook management (setWebhook, deleteWebhook, verifyWebhookSecret)
  - Chat ID resolution with in-memory cache (resolveChatId, invalidateChatIdCache)
  - Scheduling permission checks (checkSchedulingPermissions)
  - Schedule verification (verifyScheduled) — detects Telegram's silent schedule_date drops
  - publishToChannel dispatcher — picks the right API method per media type
  - extractContent — parses Telegram updates into Fredy's internal shape
  - AbortController timeout on every fetch call (15s)

- **KVStore** — full real implementation:
  - Basic CRUD (get, getJson, set, setJson, delete, list)
  - Batched stats (bumpStats, bumpGlobalStats, flushAllStats) — in-memory cache, flushes every 10 increments
  - Media group buffering (saveMediaGroupItem, listMediaGroupItems, deleteMediaGroup) with 180s TTL
  - Scheduling queue (enqueueScheduled, listDueScheduled, deleteScheduledItem) with 7-day TTL
  - Last scheduled timestamp tracking (getLastScheduledTime, setLastScheduledTime)
  - Stats reset (resetStats)

- **Logger** — full real implementation:
  - Four log levels (error, warn, info, debug) with proper console routing
  - KV ring buffers (30 entries each) — updates, errors, raw requests
  - Conditional KV writes (only when DEBUG_MODE === "true")
  - rawRequest logging for webhook requests
  - Readers (getRecentUpdates, getRecentErrors, getRecentRawRequests)
  - clear() and counts() for dashboard

- **DebugService** — full real implementation:
  - Pluggable test registration (registerTest, listTests, runTest)
  - getStatus with full env introspection (secrets masked via maskValue)
  - Built-in tests: ping, testKv, testTelegramMessage
  - Log readers and clearLogs

- **Webhook entry** — full real implementation:
  - Webhook secret verification (403 on mismatch, with raw request logging)
  - JSON body parsing (400 on invalid, with raw request logging)
  - Update info extraction for logging (without exposing full bodies)
  - ctx.waitUntil pattern — returns 200 immediately, all work in background
  - Batched stats flush after every request

- **Cron entry** — full real implementation:
  - Two-cron dispatch (every-minute tick + 15-minute source refresh)
  - processScheduledQueue — sends due messages from KV queue, handles permanent errors
  - Scheduler orchestrator integration

- **Debug entry** — full real implementation:
  - 11 endpoints: dashboard HTML, ping, status, tests list, logs (updates/errors/raw), clear, test/kv, test/message, test/cron, test/:name
  - Self-contained HTML dashboard with dark theme, status cards, test buttons, log viewer
  - Auto-refresh status every 30s
  - Bearer token auth (when DEBUG_TOKEN set)

- **Health endpoint** — enhanced:
  - Version, phase, uptime, presence flags (no secrets leaked)
  - GET /webhook/info — bot info for setup

- **Container** — updated:
  - Logger injected into DebugService
  - All wiring verified
