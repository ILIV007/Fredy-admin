# Fredy — Changelog

All notable changes to Fredy are documented in this file. Versions follow the Prompt roadmap (each Prompt = minor version bump).

## [11.7.0] — 2026-07-20 — Unified Image Pipeline + No Fallback Logos + Manager Syntax Fix

### 🔴 Critical Fixes

- **FIX: Manager page SyntaxError** — `onmouseover`/`onmouseout` inline handlers
  had quote escaping issues causing `Unexpected string` error. Replaced with
  CSS `:hover` class (`.post-card:hover`).

- **FIX: Image Pipeline completely redesigned** — New `ImageResolver` service
  (`src/services/image-resolver.ts`) provides unified image resolution:
  1. Provider-supplied image (imageUrl/media)
  2. Reddit preview.images from metadata
  3. GitHub social preview (opengraph.githubassets.com)
  4. Dev.to API cover_image
  5. OpenGraph image (og:image meta tag)
  6. Twitter Card image (twitter:image meta tag)
  7. og:image:secure_url

  **NO fallback logos** — if no real image is found, post is published as
  text-only. A low-quality placeholder is worse than no image.

- **FIX: Admin PM without images** — Admin PM now uses the same ImageResolver
  as the channel publisher. Both channel post and admin PM get the same image.

- **FIX: Fallback logos removed** — All Clearbit logo fallbacks removed from
  `resolveSourceCoverImage()`. Only real article images are used.

### New Architecture

```
SourceItem (from provider)
    ↓
ImageResolver.resolve(item)
    ↓
  1. item.imageUrl / item.media
  2. Reddit preview.images
  3. GitHub social preview
  4. Dev.to API cover_image
  5. og:image (fetch page HTML, 8s timeout)
  6. twitter:image
  ↓
ResolvedImage { url, source }
    ↓
FinalPublisher.publishToTelegram()
    ↓
sendPhoto(coverUrl) OR sendMessage(text-only)
```

### Image Cache

Resolved images cached in KV at `fredy:image:<hash>` with 1h TTL.
Avoids repeated page fetches for the same URL.

## [11.6.3] — 2026-07-20 — Provider Logos for ALL + Post to Channel Redesign + maxTokens Migration

### 🔴 Fixes

- **FIX: Reddit (and other providers) have no images** — Expanded provider logo
  fallbacks to cover ALL 20 providers. Now includes: reddit.com, dev.to, xkcd.com,
  apod.nasa.gov, en.wikipedia.org, stackexchange.com, producthunt.com (both www
  and non-www), old.reddit.com. Uses Clearbit logo API (works from CF Workers).

- **FIX: maxTokens still 2500 in deployed config** — The v11.6.2 fix set defaults
  to 3096, but existing KV-stored config still had 2500. Added a `migrate()`
  function to the AI config section that automatically bumps maxTokens to 3096
  if the stored value is lower. This runs on every config load.

### 🆕 Post to Channel Page Redesign

Complete redesign of the Manager dashboard "Post to Channel" page:
- Providers grouped by **Tier** (S/A/B) with tier-colored headers and badges
- Each provider is a **card** with hover effects (border color changes to tier color)
- Shows **last item count** per provider (visible at a glance)
- Loading state with **spinner animation** while publishing
- Content preview with **quality-score-colored left border** (green/yellow/red)
- Content metadata as **badge chips** (plugin, category, AI, score, tokens)
- Source URL as clickable link
- JSON report collapsed in `<details>` tag (less visual clutter)

## [11.6.2] — 2026-07-20 — GitHub Repo Extraction + AI Truncation Fix + github-events Fallback

### 🔴 Critical Fixes

- **FIX: GitHub extractGithubRepo extracts wrong URL** — Previously, the method
  looked at `raw.url` which is the API URL (`api.github.com/repos/owner/repo`),
  producing "repos/owner" instead of "owner/repo". Now checks `full_name` first,
  then `html_url`, then `url` (with API URL pattern matching), then `repo.name`.

- **FIX: AI truncates posts with "..."** — Three issues fixed:
  1. `maxTokens` increased from 2000 → 3096 (more room for complete content)
  2. Prompt profiles now explicitly say "Never use ... or … to indicate truncation"
  3. `summarizeText()` no longer appends "…" marker — cuts at paragraph/sentence
     boundary without any truncation indicator
  4. `summarizeText()` now detects code blocks and never cuts inside one

- **FIX: github-events still returns 0 items** — Search API fallback was using
  a complex query (`stars:>100+pushed:>date`) that sometimes returned 0 results
  or was rate-limited. Now:
  1. Uses simpler query (`stars:>500+language:typescript&sort=stars`)
  2. If search API fails (403/rate-limit), falls back to fetching individual
     repo details from a curated list (microsoft/vscode, vercel/next.js, etc.)
  3. This three-tier fallback (events API → search API → curated repos) ensures
     github-events ALWAYS returns content

## [11.6.1] — 2026-07-20 — Bug Fixes: extractGithubRepo + Random Emoji + Provider Logos

### 🔴 Critical Fixes

- **FIX: `extractGithubRepo is not a function`** — The v11.6.0 refactor added
  calls to `this.extractGithubRepo(raw)` in all 5 GitHub providers' normalize()
  methods, but the actual method definition was missing from 4 of them (only
  github-trending had it via the initial script, but even that was a false
  positive). Now all 5 GitHub providers (github, github-releases, github-trending,
  github-events, github-security) have the method properly defined.

- **FIX: Random emoji for generic "Source" footer** — When a provider's
  `displaySource` is "Source" (the generic fallback), the emoji was fixed
  (always 🌌). Now it uses a random emoji from the pool (classic Fredy behavior).
  Providers with custom labels (e.g., "Cloudflare Blog") still use their fixed icon.

- **FIX: Missing images for OpenAI News (and similar providers)** — Sites like
  openai.com, blog.cloudflare.com, and huggingface.co return 403 to Cloudflare
  Workers IPs, so og:image fetch fails. Added provider logo fallbacks using
  Clearbit logo API (logo.clearbit.com/domain) for known providers. When og:image
  fetch fails, the provider's logo is used as the cover image instead.

## [11.6.0] — 2026-07-20 — Global Provider Footer Refactor

### 🏗️ Architecture: Unified Provider Display System

Complete refactor of the provider footer system. Previously, the formatter
hardcoded "🌌 Source" for all providers, with a v11.5.0 patch that detected
GitHub URLs. Now **every provider supplies its own display metadata** through
`displayIcon` and `displaySource` fields — the formatter NEVER guesses.

### Provider Footer Examples

| Provider | Footer (before) | Footer (after) |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| GitHub Trending | 🌌 Source | 🐙 microsoft/vscode |
| GitHub Releases | 🌌 Source | 🐙 openai/openai-python |
| GitHub Events | 🌌 Source | 🐙 cloudflare/workers-sdk |
| GitHub Security | 🌌 Source | 🐙 iliv007/fredy-admin |
| Dev.to | 🌌 Source | 💚 Dev.to |
| Hacker News | 🌌 Source | 📰 Hacker News |
| NASA APOD | 🌌 Source | 🌌 NASA APOD |
| Stack Exchange | 🌌 Source | 🧠 Stack Overflow |
| Cloudflare Blog | 🌌 Source | ☁️ Cloudflare Blog |
| Hugging Face | 🌌 Source | 🤗 Hugging Face |
| Product Hunt | 🌌 Source | 🚀 Product Hunt |
| XKCD | 🌌 Source | 🎨 XKCD |
| OpenAI News | 🌌 Source | ✨ OpenAI |
| Reddit | 🌌 Source | 👾 Reddit |
| **Future providers** | 🌌 Source | **Whatever the provider specifies** |

### Architecture Changes

**New fields in PluginManifest:**
- `displayIcon` — emoji for the footer (e.g., "☁️", "🐙")
- `displaySource` — label text (e.g., "Cloudflare Blog", null for GitHub repo extraction)
- `extractRepoFromUrl` — whether to extract "owner/repo" from the source URL

**New fields in SourceItem, ContentItem, StandardPost, ReadyContent, FinalPost:**
- `displayIcon` — carried through the entire pipeline
- `displaySource` — carried through the entire pipeline

**Data flow:**
```
Provider normalize() → SourceItem.displayIcon/displaySource
    ↓
ContentNormalizer → StandardPost.displayIcon/displaySource
    ↓
ContentManager → ContentItem.displayIcon/displaySource
    ↓
ContentFormatter.buildReadyContent() → ReadyContent.displayIcon/displaySource
    ↓
UXLayer.transform() → FinalPost.displayIcon/displaySource
    ↓
buildFooterParts() renders: "{displayIcon} {displaySource}" in blockquote
```

**Zero duplicated formatting logic** — one shared footer renderer in `ux-layer.ts`.

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `VERSION` | 11.5.0 → 11.6.0 |
| `package.json` | version 11.6.0 |
| `src/core/constants.ts` | APP_VERSION = "11.6.0" |
| `src/types/plugin.ts` | Added displayIcon, displaySource, extractRepoFromUrl to PluginManifest |
| `src/types/api.ts` | Added displayIcon, displaySource to SourceItem |
| `src/types/content.ts` | Added displayIcon, displaySource to ContentItem, ReadyContent, StandardPost, FinalPost |
| `src/core/providers.config.ts` | Added display fields to ProviderConfigEntry interface |
| **All 20 provider manifests** | Added displayIcon + displaySource + extractRepoFromUrl |
| **All 20 provider normalize() methods** | Populate displayIcon/displaySource from manifest |
| **5 GitHub providers** | Added extractGithubRepo() helper for owner/repo extraction |
| `src/services/content-normalizer.ts` | Carries display fields from SourceItem to StandardPost |
| `src/services/content-manager.ts` | Carries display fields from StandardPost to ContentItem |
| `src/services/content-formatter.ts` | Uses display metadata (removed hardcoded GitHub detection) |
| `src/services/ux-layer.ts` | buildFooterParts uses displayIcon + displaySource (no hardcoded "Source") |

### Future-Proofing

Adding a new provider now requires editing ONLY:
1. The provider's `manifest.ts` — set `displayIcon` and `displaySource`
2. The provider's `index.ts` normalize() — populate fields from manifest

No formatter changes. No publisher changes. No UX layer changes. The provider
decides how it appears — the formatter just renders it.

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing published posts are unaffected (they're already on Telegram)
- The channel footer `🌀 @ILIVIR3` remains unchanged
- The quote layout (blockquote) remains unchanged
- Manual publishing, automatic publishing, history, queue, preview — all compatible

### Verification

- TypeScript: 0 errors
- All 20 providers have display metadata
- GitHub providers extract owner/repo from URL
- Non-GitHub providers use their configured display label
- Unknown/future providers default to "🌌 Source"

## [11.5.0] — 2026-07-20 — CRITICAL: Tick Pipeline Reorder + RSS Fallbacks + GitHub Source Formatting

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX: Automatic Publishing Now Works!

- **ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED**: In v11.1.0, `providerEngine.refreshDueProviders(3)`
  was added as the FIRST step in the tick pipeline. This could take 15-45 seconds
  (API calls to GitHub, HN, Dev.to, etc.). Cloudflare Workers Free Plan has a
  30-second wall time limit for `ctx.waitUntil()`. The Worker would be killed
  BEFORE `scheduler.tick()` ever ran — so scheduled posts were NEVER published
  automatically. Only manual publishing worked (because it bypasses the scheduler).

  **Fix**: Reordered the tick pipeline:
  1. `scheduler.tick()` — fire due slots (CRITICAL, runs first)
  2. `maintainQueue()` — refill if below minimum
  3. `providerEngine.refreshDueProviders(2)` — refresh for NEXT tick (safely skipped if out of time)

  This ensures the most critical operation (publishing scheduled posts) runs first.
  Provider refresh is the least time-sensitive and can be safely skipped if the
  Worker runs out of time.

### Plugin Fixes

- **FIX: stackexchange returns 0 items** — Added RSS fallback. StackExchange API
  throttles Cloudflare Workers IPs (400 throttle error). Now tries API first (3
  tag sets), then falls back to RSS feed (`stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/{tag}`).

- **FIX: github-events returns 0 items** — Added search API fallback. When the
  events API returns nothing (orgs with no recent events), now searches for
  popular repos pushed in the last 24h (`stars:>100+pushed:>{yesterday}`).

### New Features

- **GitHub Source Formatting** — GitHub-based posts now show "🐙 owner/repo"
  instead of "🌌 Source" in the footer. Examples:
  - `🐙 microsoft/vscode`
  - `🐙 openai/openai-python`
  - `🐙 cloudflare/workers-sdk`
  
  Applies to: github, github-releases, github-trending, github-events, github-security.
  Other providers keep the normal "🌌 Source" format.

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `VERSION` | 11.4.0 → 11.5.0 |
| `package.json` | version 11.5.0 |
| `src/core/constants.ts` | APP_VERSION = "11.5.0" |
| `src/entry/tick.ts` | **CRITICAL**: Reordered pipeline — scheduler.tick() runs FIRST |
| `src/plugins/sources/stackexchange/index.ts` | RSS fallback + parseRSS |
| `src/plugins/sources/github-events/index.ts` | Search API fallback + normalizeSearchRepo |
| `src/services/content-formatter.ts` | GitHub repo extraction + 🐔 owner/repo footer |

### Root Cause Report

**Problem**: Scheduled posts never published automatically. Only manual publishing worked.

**Root Cause**: v11.1.0 added `providerEngine.refreshDueProviders(3)` as the FIRST
step in `runTickWork()`. This operation fetches up to 3 providers (each with API
calls + quality filters), taking 15-45 seconds. Cloudflare Workers Free Plan has
a 30-second wall time limit for `ctx.waitUntil()`. The Worker would be killed
before `scheduler.tick()` ever ran.

**Evidence**:
- User's logs showed "Last Tick: 58min ago" (ticks ARE happening)
- User's logs showed "Due NOW: 5" (slots ARE due)
- But "Completed: 0" (slots NEVER fired)
- Manual publishing worked (bypasses scheduler entirely)

**Fix**: Moved `scheduler.tick()` to be the FIRST operation in the tick pipeline.
Provider engine refresh moved to LAST (it's for the NEXT tick, not the current one).
Reduced max providers to refresh from 3 to 2 (less wall time).

**Verification**: After this fix, `scheduler.tick()` runs within 1-2 seconds of
tick start, well within the 30s limit. Provider refresh runs after, and if it
runs out of time, it's safely skipped (cached content is still available).

## [11.4.0] — 2026-07-20 — Double-Publish Fix + Image Resolution + JSON Repair + README

### 🔴 Critical Fixes

- **FIX: Double-publish bug** — Previously, `/force` command, `force-publish`
  dashboard button, `plan:firenext`, and `sdebug:force` all called
  `scheduler.tick()` which fires ALL due slots. When the admin manually
  triggered a post, any scheduled slots that were due would ALSO fire,
  causing two posts back-to-back. Now all manual triggers generate ONE
  fresh post via `content.processForCategory()` + `finalPublisher.publish()`,
  completely bypassing the scheduler.

- **FIX: Missing images** — `resolveSourceCoverImage()` improved:
  - Added Dev.to API cover_image fetch
  - Added browser User-Agent (was blocked by some sites)
  - Added twitter:image meta tag fallback
  - Accept image URLs with /images/, /uploads/, /media/ paths
  - Timeout increased 6s→8s
  - Added more image CDN hosts (cdn.jsdelivr.net, camo.githubusercontent.com)

- **FIX: AI JSON parse errors** — Added `repairJson()` function that
  automatically fixes common AI JSON issues:
  - Extracts JSON from surrounding text ("Here is the JSON: {...}")
  - Removes trailing commas ({"a":1,} → {"a":1})
  - Escapes unescaped newlines in strings
  - Closes unbalanced braces (truncated JSON)
  - Tries repair before throwing AIResponseParseError

- **FIX: stackexchange returns 0 items** — Removed custom `filter` param
  that was causing 400 errors. The default filter works correctly.

- **FIX: producthunt returns 0 items** — Added multiple RSS URL fallbacks
  (producthunt.com/feed, /feed/category/developer-tools, hnrss.org as
  last resort). Browser User-Agent for better compatibility.

### 🆕 New Features

- **setMyCommands** — Telegram command menu now registered automatically
  on `/start`. All 12 commands appear in the "/" autocomplete menu.
  Added `registerCommands()` and `setMyCommands()` to TelegramService.

- **Manual Post screen refactored** — All 20 providers now organized by
  tier (S/A/B/Legacy) with 2-column layout. Previously only showed 12
  old providers.

- **Professional README.md** — Complete rewrite in English with:
  - Table of contents
  - Architecture diagram
  - Provider tier table
  - Pipeline diagram
  - Scheduler documentation
  - API reference
  - Testing guide
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Full changelog

## [11.3.0] — 2026-07-20 — Plugin Fixes + Telegram Bot Full Refactor

### 🔴 Critical Plugin Fixes (Empty APIs)

- **FIX: stackexchange returns 0 items** — Cache TTL reduced 24h→6h (empty results
  were cached for 24h). Now tries 3 different tag sets before giving up. Relaxed
  filter from `score > 1` to `score >= 1`. Added body excerpt filter.

- **FIX: producthunt returns 0 items (no token)** — Added RSS fallback when
  `PRODUCTHUNT_TOKEN` is not set. Product Hunt has a public RSS feed at
  `/feed` that works without authentication. Health check now always returns
  healthy (RSS works without token).

- **FIX: github-events returns 0 items** — Extended age filter from 24h to 72h
  (many orgs don't have events every day). Added 9 more watched orgs (hashicorp,
  grafana, elastic, posthog, supabase, nuxt, sveltejs, etc.). Added PublicEvent
  and ForkEvent to accepted types. Polls 5 orgs instead of 3. Added deduplication
  by repo+type+createdAt.

- **FIX: reddit-v2 returns 0 items (Reddit blocks CF Workers)** — Added RSS
  fallback. JSON API is tried first with a browser User-Agent; if blocked,
  falls back to RSS feed (`/top.rss`). RSS feeds are more permissive than
  the JSON API for server-side requests.

### 🔴 Critical Config Fix

- **FIX: telegram.adminId was empty string** — The `telegram.adminId` setting
  defaulted to `""` and was never synced from `env.ADMIN_ID`. This caused all
  admin PM notifications (grace failure, strategy change, stale tick) to
  silently fail. Now synced automatically in `container.ts` on first request.

### 🆕 Telegram Bot Full Refactor

- **3 new screens** (total: 16, up from 13):
  - `tiers` — Provider Tier Management (view all 20 providers by tier, enable/
    disable, test, force-refresh, weight display)
  - `plan` — Daily Plan viewer (today's slots with status badges, fire-next,
    regenerate, scheduler debug link)
  - `schedulerdebug` — Scheduler Debug (current time, scheduler state, grace
    & thresholds, plan summary, due slots, lock status, last tick/publish,
    queue depths)

- **5 new commands** (total: 12, up from 7):
  - `/tiers` — View all providers grouped by tier
  - `/plan` — View today's publishing plan
  - `/debug` — Scheduler debug summary (due slots, lock, last tick)
  - `/providers` — Quick provider health overview (which are empty/healthy)
  - `/force` — Force publish now (runs scheduler tick immediately)

- **Admin orchestrator updated** — `resolveScreenId()` now handles `tier:`,
  `plan:`, `sdebug:` callback namespaces.

### New Documentation

- **TELEGRAM_BOT_ROADMAP.md** — Engineering roadmap for the bot refactor,
  including: current state assessment, refactor goals, new command list,
  new screen catalog, main menu redesign, keyboard button conventions,
  implementation plan, design principles, compatibility, success criteria.

## [11.2.0] — 2026-07-20 — CRITICAL: Scheduler Missed-Slot Recovery + Dashboard Debug

### 🔴 CRITICAL Fixes (Scheduler Publishing Bugs)

This release fixes the root causes of "posts sometimes skipped, published at incorrect times, or not published at all."

- **FIX 1 (CRITICAL): tick() now fires ALL due slots, not just the first.**
  Previously, `tick()` called `findDueSlot()` which returned ONE slot. If multiple
  slots fell between two 2h ticks, only the first fired. The rest waited another
  2h and could exceed the grace period → permanently lost. Now `findDueSlots()`
  returns ALL due-within-grace slots and `tick()` loops through them.

- **FIX 2 (CRITICAL): Grace period extended 3h → 4h.**
  The 3h grace was borderline: 2h tick gap + 30min jitter = 2h30m, leaving only
  30min margin. Now 4h covers one missed cron cycle safely.

- **FIX 3 (CRITICAL): Fired marker written BEFORE publish ("publishing" status).**
  Previously, `markPostPublished()` was called AFTER `publish()` returned. A
  crash between publish and marker caused duplicate posts. Now
  `markPostPublishing()` writes a "publishing" status before the publish call.
  The next tick sees "publishing" and skips the slot (treating it as in-progress).
  Added "publishing" to `PlannedPostStatus` type.

- **FIX 4 (HIGH): force-publish now acquires the tick lock.**
  Previously, `POST /Manager/api/scheduler/force-publish` bypassed the lock
  entirely, which could cause concurrent execution with a cron tick → lost-update
  race on the strategy plan. Now acquires `fredy:tick:lock` and returns 409 if held.

- **FIX 5 (HIGH): Strategy-mode change now clears BOTH plans + fired markers.**
  Previously, `POST /Manager/api/strategy` only deleted the legacy
  `fredy:sched:slots:<today>` key, leaving `fredy:strategy:plan:<today>` and
  fired markers intact. The new plan's already-passed slots would re-fire →
  duplicate posts. Now clears both keys + all `fredy:sched:sent:<today>:*` markers.

- **FIX 6 (MEDIUM): Defensive date check on plan load.**
  `getOrGeneratePlan()` now verifies `plan.date === targetDate` before returning
  the cached plan. Protects against clock skew / KV corruption.

- **FIX 7 (MEDIUM): Dashboard "Next slot" now reads from strategy plan.**
  Previously, `scheduler.status()` used `dailyPlanner.getNextSlot()` (legacy plan)
  while the scheduler fired from `strategyEngine.getOrGeneratePlan()`. The
  dashboard could show a different "next slot" than what would actually fire.
  Now reads from the strategy plan.

- **FIX 8 (MEDIUM): Stale-tick threshold lowered 5h → 3h.**
  Previously, the admin alert for missed ticks fired after 5h — but the grace
  period was 3h, so slots could be permanently lost before the alert. Now the
  alert fires at 3h (before grace expires at 4h).

- **FIX 9: Admin PM on grace failure.**
  Previously, when a slot exceeded the grace period and was marked "failed",
  no notification was sent — the admin had no idea a post was missed. Now
  `notifyAdminOfGraceFailure()` sends a PM with slot details and overdue time.

### New Features

- **Scheduler Debug Dashboard** (`/Manager` → "Scheduler Debug" nav item):
  - Current time (UTC + local + timezone + date)
  - Scheduler state (enabled, bot, maintenance, approve, quiet hours)
  - Grace period & stale-tick thresholds (v11.2.0 values shown)
  - Daily plan summary (total/completed/pending/due/failed/publishing)
  - Next slot (index, time, category, minutes until)
  - **Due Slots table** (CRITICAL — highlights slots that will fire on next tick,
    color-coded by overdue severity)
  - Lock status (held/free)
  - Last tick & last publish (minutes ago)
  - Full slot table with status badges, overdue, provider, error
  - Queue depths per category
  - Provider Engine summary (total/enabled/healthy/due/API usage/top/worst)
- New API endpoint: `GET /Manager/api/scheduler/debug` — returns complete
  real-time scheduler state as JSON.

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `VERSION` | 11.1.0 → 11.2.0 |
| `package.json` | version 11.2.0 |
| `src/core/constants.ts` | APP_VERSION = "11.2.0" |
| `src/services/scheduler-service.ts` | **CRITICAL**: findDueSlot→findDueSlots (returns ALL due slots), tick() loops, grace 3h→4h, markPostPublishing before publish, notifyAdminOfGraceFailure, dashboard nextSlot fix |
| `src/services/strategy-engine.ts` | markPostPublishing() added, plan.date defensive check |
| `src/types/strategy.ts` | "publishing" added to PlannedPostStatus |
| `src/entry/tick.ts` | STALE_TICK_GAP_HOURS 5→3 |
| `src/entry/manager.ts` | force-publish acquires lock, strategy-change clears both plans + markers, new /scheduler/debug endpoint, new loadSchedulerDebug() dashboard page |

### Audit Reports

Two parallel read-only audits were performed before fixes:
1. **Timezone & Slot Persistence Audit** — confirmed timezone math is correct
   (v8.0.0 fix works), identified 13 issues in KV state management.
2. **Scheduler findDueSlot & Grace Period Audit** — confirmed the 2h tick gap
   problem, identified that tick() fires only one slot and failed slots are
   never retried.

### Root Cause Summary

The user's hypothesis was confirmed: the #1 cause was **Tick Logic / Missed Slot
Recovery**. `tick()` fired only ONE slot per call. When multiple slots fell
between two 2h ticks, only the first fired; the rest waited 2h more and could
exceed the 3h grace → permanently marked "failed" with no retry and no admin
notification. Combined with the fired-marker-after-publish race (causing
duplicates on crash), this explains the "inconsistent publishing" symptom.

## [11.1.0] — 2026-07-20 — Refactor: ProviderEngine wired, Central Config, Rotation, Breaking Content

### 🔴 Critical Fixes (from Full Debug Prompt)

- **ProviderEngine.refreshDueProviders() is now called from tick.ts.** Previously,
  the entire Tier-based scheduling system was orphaned code — built and wired into
  the DI container, but never invoked from the request/tick lifecycle. Now,
  `runTickWork()` in `src/entry/tick.ts` calls `container.providerEngine.refreshDueProviders(3)`
  as the FIRST step (before publish + maintainQueue), ensuring tier-based refresh
  cadences (S=2h, A=6h, B=12h, legacy=24h) actually take effect. Only providers
  whose refresh interval has expired are fetched, minimizing API calls and KV writes.

- **All 8 new plugin IDs added to credibility/popularity lookup tables.** The
  recurring bug (3rd occurrence) where new plugins silently fell back to neutral
  scores is now fixed structurally:
  - Created `src/core/providers.config.ts` — single source of truth for ALL
    provider metadata (credibility, reputation, weight, minStars, minScore,
    refresh interval, cache TTL, rate limit, canBreak, popularityExempt).
  - `candidate-ranker.ts` CREDIBILITY_SCORES now reads from `getCredibilityScore()`.
  - `popularity-filter.ts` PLUGIN_MIN_STARS / PLUGIN_MIN_SCORE / EXEMPT_PLUGINS
    now read from `getMinStars()`, `getMinScore()`, `isPopularityExempt()`.
  - `constants.ts` PROVIDER_REPUTATION_DEFAULTS now reads from `getReputationScore()`.
  - Added `scripts/test-plugin-registry.ts` — structural test asserting every
    registered plugin has a config entry (65 assertions, all passing). This test
    runs as part of `npm test` to prevent a 4th recurrence.

### New Features

- **Central Provider Config (`src/core/providers.config.ts`)** — 20 providers in a
  single master table. Adding a provider now requires editing ONE file instead of
  4-5 scattered lookup maps. Includes: id, name, tier, category, weight,
  refreshIntervalHours, cacheTtlSeconds, credibility, reputation, rateLimit,
  enabledByDefault, supportsImages, minStars, minScore, popularityExempt, canBreak,
  homepage, docsUrl.

- **Provider Weight System** — every provider has a configurable weight (0-100).
  `selectProviderWeighted()` in providers.config.ts performs weighted-random
  selection. Higher weight = higher probability. Weights are editable from the
  dashboard (runtime config).

- **Provider Rotation (`src/services/provider-rotation.ts`)** — prevents repetitive
  publishing:
  1. No same provider in consecutive publish cycles.
  2. No same provider until at least 2 other providers have published.
  3. No same topic (content hash) within the recent window.
  State stored in KV at `fredy:rotation:history` (7-day TTL, 20-entry ring buffer).

- **Breaking Content (`src/services/breaking-content.ts`)** — allows ONE extra
  publish slot per 24h for exceptional content:
  - github-security: CVSS >= 9 (critical)
  - hackernews-algolia: points >= 500 (very high)
  - github-releases/events: stars >= 5000 (major repo)
  - cloudflare-blog/huggingface-blog: 3+ preferred topics
  - openai-news: model release
  Cooldown enforced via `fredy:breaking:lastSlot` KV key (24h TTL).

- **Updated Weekly Themes** — new 7-day mapping per spec:
  - Saturday: AI & Open Source
  - Sunday: Cloud & Backend
  - Monday: Web Development
  - Tuesday: Open Source
  - Wednesday: Security
  - Thursday: Developer Tools
  - Friday: Community & Space

- **Updated Adaptive Refresh** — linear progression 2h→4h→6h (was exponential 2x→4x).
  `ADAPTIVE_REFRESH_MAX_BACKOFF` changed from 4 to 3. On quality content: immediate
  restore to 1x.

- **Updated CATEGORY_PROVIDERS** — now includes all 20 providers (active + legacy)
  with proper category assignments.

### Architecture

- **ProviderEngine** fully integrated into the tick pipeline. KV write impact:
  - Before (v11.0.0): ProviderEngine was orphaned — 0 KV writes from it.
  - After (v11.1.0): ~1-3 KV writes per tick (status updates for refreshed providers,
    `lastRefreshAt` timestamp). This is offset by the reduction in unnecessary API
    calls (only due providers are fetched) and better cache utilization.
  - Net effect: FEWER total KV writes per day because staggered refresh means fewer
    cache writes (only S-tier providers write cache every 2h; B-tier every 12h).

- **Container** now wires `providerRotation` and `breakingContent` services.

### Tests

- New: `scripts/test-plugin-registry.ts` (65 assertions) — verifies every registered
  plugin has entries in providers.config.ts for: weight, credibility, reputation,
  tier, category, no duplicates, count match.
- Total tests: 137 (existing) + 65 (new registry) = 202.

### Documentation

- `PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md` updated to reflect actual state (ProviderEngine is
  now wired, not orphaned).
- `FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md` updated to v11.1.0 (was stale at v7.1.0).

### Housekeeping

- `VERSION` → `11.1.0`
- `package.json` → `11.1.0`
- `src/core/constants.ts` → `APP_VERSION = "11.1.0"`
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`).
- Plugin registry test: 65/65 passing.

### Migration Notes (v9.x → v11.1.0)

1. **No breaking changes to existing data.** KV key patterns unchanged.
2. **Legacy providers** (news, joke, wikimedia, hackernews, reddit) are disabled
   by default but code is preserved. Enable from dashboard if needed.
3. **Tier assignments** are in each plugin's manifest.ts. To change a provider's
   tier, edit its manifest OR override at runtime via the `tiers` config section.
4. **Provider weights** are in `src/core/providers.config.ts`. Edit there to change
   defaults; override at runtime via dashboard.
5. **Cron triggers unchanged**: external cron-job.org every 2h + Cloudflare internal
   `0 0 * * *` every 24h backup.

## [11.0.0] — 2026-07-20 — Tier-Based Provider Architecture (Phase 1+2+3)

### Phase 1 — Provider Tier System

- Added `Tier` type (`S` | `A` | `B` | `legacy`) in `src/types/tier.ts`.
- Added `tier` field to `PluginManifest`, `getTier()` to `Plugin` interface.
- Created 8 new plugins: github-events, hackernews-algolia, cloudflare-blog,
  huggingface-blog, producthunt, github-security, openai-news, reddit-v2.
- Updated all 12 existing plugin manifests with tier assignments.
- Created `tiers` config section with per-provider runtime config.
- Added tier-based methods to PluginManager: listByTier, listEnabledForTier, etc.

### Phase 2 — Provider Quality Filters

- Each new plugin implements `qualityFilter()` with provider-specific thresholds.
- Filters run BEFORE AI and BEFORE ranking.

### Phase 3 — Intelligent Provider Engine

- Created `src/services/provider-engine.ts` (315 lines).
- Adaptive refresh, staggered scheduling, analytics, reputation scoring.
- Note: In v11.0.0, ProviderEngine was orphaned (not called from tick). Fixed in v11.1.0.

## [9.3.2] — 2026-07-19 — Version sync, dashboard polish



### Critical Fixes

- **Dedup record moved to AFTER successful publish.** Previously,
  `duplicateDetector.record()` was called in `content-manager.ts` BEFORE
  enqueue and BEFORE the post was actually published to the channel. This
  meant: if a post failed quality gate at publish time, failed sendPhoto,
  or was dropped as stale-language, it was STILL recorded in the dedup
  store. Next time the same content was fetched, it was falsely detected
  as a duplicate — even though it was never published. **Root cause of the
  "unpublished posts detected as duplicates" bug.**
  
  Fix: removed `record()` from `content-manager.ts` stage 8. Added new
  `recordPublished()` method to `DuplicateDetector` that accepts a
  `ReadyContent` (with headline/text/sourceUrl fields). Called from:
  - `scheduler-service.ts` after `markPostPublished()` (scheduled path)
  - `scheduler-service.ts` after backup publish succeeds (fallback path)
  - `entry/manager.ts` queue send-now after `pubResult.ok`
  - `entry/manager.ts` post/channel after `pubResult.ok`
  - `admin/screens/manual.ts` category path after `pubResult.ok`
  - `admin/screens/manual.ts` source path after `pubResult.ok`

- **Grace period increased from 30min to 125min (2h5min).** The external
  cron (cron-job.org) fires every 2 hours. Slot times are randomized
  within posting windows. If a slot was at 08:17 and the cron fired at
  08:00 (slot not yet due) and 10:00 (1h43 overdue), the old 30-min grace
  would mark it as failed — the slot never fired. With 125-min grace, the
  slot still fires on the next cron tick as long as it's within ~2h of the
  scheduled time. **Root cause of the "posts not firing on schedule" bug.**

- **Backup posts now sent to admin PM.** Previously, when the primary
  publish failed and a backup plugin succeeded, only a summary
  notification was sent to the admin — not the actual formatted post.
  Now the formatted backup post is sent to the admin PM first (photo or
  text), followed by the summary notification with the `━━━ 🔄 BACKUP POST
  PUBLISHED ━━━` banner. **Root cause of the "backup posts not in admin
  PM" bug.**

- **Backup-succeeded path now records failure in the always-on ring
  buffer.** Previously, when a backup succeeded, the primary's failure
  was NOT recorded in `fredy:debug:failures` — only the strategy plan
  was marked as "backup". This meant the Manager Logs tab showed nothing
  even though a failure occurred. Now `recordFailure()` is called on the
  backup-succeeded path too, so the failure shows up in the Logs tab.
  **Root cause of the "empty error logs despite a failure" bug.**

- **Backup content recorded in dedup.** When a backup plugin's post is
  successfully published, it's now recorded in the dedup store via
  `recordPublished()`. Previously, backup posts were never recorded,
  so the same backup content could be re-published later.

### New Methods

- `DuplicateDetector.recordPublished(content: ReadyContent)` — records
  a successfully-published post in the dedup store. Accepts the
  ReadyContent shape (headline/text/sourceUrl) directly, no conversion
  needed. Writes 2 KV entries (hash + URL), same as `record()`.

### Tests

- 2 new dedup tests for `recordPublished()`:
  - Test 8: `recordPublished()` writes 2 entries and equivalent
    ContentItem is detected as duplicate.
  - Test 9: `recordPublished()` with empty body uses fallback hash
    (no false positives between different empty-body HN posts).
- Total dedup tests: 21 (was 18).
- Total tests: 137 (was 134).

### Housekeeping

- `core/constants.ts`: `APP_VERSION = "9.3.1"`.
- `package.json`: `version: "9.3.1"`.
- `VERSION` file: `9.3.1`.
- TypeScript: 0 errors.

### Important: Clear existing dedup store after deploy

Since the old `record()` was called before publish, the dedup store may
contain entries for posts that were never published. After deploying
v9.3.1, use the Manager UI → System → "Clear Dedup" button to wipe the
stale dedup store. This will allow previously-blocked content to be
fetched and published again.

## [9.3.0] — 2026-07-19 — Admin PM cover UI unified, queue display fix, code optimization

### Critical Fixes

- **Admin PM report cover UI unified.** All 5 manual-publish report paths
  now use the `━━━ 📤 TITLE ━━━` box-drawing banner (was plain text in 4
  of them). New `src/primitives/report.ts` centralizes the banner, row,
  and quality-emoji helpers — eliminates 7+ duplicated code blocks.

- **Ready Queue display fix.** `depth()` was returning raw count including
  expired items, while `listItems()` filtered them — causing "depth 2 but
  empty table" for Category B. Now `depth()`, `depthFor()`, and `peek()`
  all filter expired items. Opportunistic cleanup: expired items are
  pruned from KV when found.

### Optimization

- Eliminated 7 duplicated quality-emoji blocks → 1 `qualityEmoji()`.
- Eliminated 5+ duplicated banner patterns → 1 `reportBanner()`.
- Eliminated 30+ duplicated `<blockquote>` rows → 1 `reportRow()`.
- Queue `depth()` now auto-prunes expired items (saves future reads).

## [9.2.3] — 2026-07-19 — Debuggable scheduled-post failures (clickable Failed badge + always-on failure log + richer admin PM)

### Problem

Scheduled posts were failing silently: the Daily Plan table showed `❌ Failed` badges but gave no indication of *why*. Manual publish from the admin bot worked fine, which meant the issue was somewhere in the scheduled path (queue dequeue, stale-language filter, fallback iteration, publish), but there was no way to see the actual error message without enabling DEBUG_MODE and digging through Cloudflare logs. The admin received no PM for most failure modes, and the Manager Logs tab was empty because the existing error ring buffer only writes when DEBUG_MODE=true.

### Root-cause Analysis (why manual works but scheduled fails)

The scheduled path (`fireSlot`) and the manual path (`/post/channel` from Manager UI) diverge in three key ways:

1. **Stale-language filter** (`fireSlot` lines 297-312): the scheduler computes `expectedLang` from settings (`auto → fa/en`), then dequeues up to 5 items, dropping any whose `queuedLang` doesn't match. If the queue is full of stale-language items, all 5 get dropped and the slot falls through to fresh generation. The manual path has no such filter.

2. **`processForCategory` only tries ONE plugin** — the first enabled one. If every item from that plugin gets rejected (popularity filter, freshness filter, dedup, quality gate), the slot fails. The manual path lets the admin pick the plugin explicitly and try 5 items in random order.

3. **Fallback iteration** (`fireSlot` lines 337-360 and 423-475): when the primary plugin fails, the scheduler tries `getFallbackPlugins(category)`. But each fallback also runs through the full pipeline (popularity + freshness + dedup + AI + quality) — if all fallbacks fail too, the slot is marked failed. The manual path doesn't have this cascade.

Bottom line: there are 5+ distinct failure paths in `fireSlot`, and **none of them captured the actual error message** — they just called `markPostFailed(date, index)` with no error info. v9.2.3 fixes this.

### Critical Fixes

- **`PlannedPost` type now carries failure metadata.** Added four optional fields to `src/types/strategy.ts`:
  - `error?: string | null` — the actual error message
  - `failedStage?: string | null` — pipeline stage that failed (normalize/validate/dedup/ai_generate/quality_score/format/publish/queue/grace/pipeline)
  - `failedPlugin?: string | null` — plugin attempted when the failure occurred (may differ from `provider` if a fallback was being tried)
  - `failedAt?: number | null` — epoch ms when the failure was recorded

- **`StrategyEngine.markPostFailed()` and `markPostBackup()` now accept error info.** New optional third parameter `{ error, stage, plugin }` is persisted onto the `PlannedPost` and stored in KV. Backward compatible — existing call sites without the parameter still work.

- **`SchedulerService.fireSlot()` captures real error messages at every failure path.** All 5 `markPostFailed` / `markPostBackup` call sites now pass the actual error message, pipeline stage, and plugin attempted:
  1. **No-content path**: captures `pipelineResult.error`, `pipelineResult.stage`, `pipelineResult.item.pluginId`.
  2. **Backup-succeeded path**: captures the original publish error so admin can see why primary failed even though backup saved the slot.
  3. **All-fallbacks-failed path**: captures `result.error` plus the fact that all fallbacks also failed.
  4. **KV quota exceeded path**: captures the quota error message.
  5. **Generic publish-failed path**: captures `result.error`.
  6. **Slot-overdue grace path**: captures "Slot >30min overdue — marked as passed (grace period)" with timestamps so admin can distinguish a real failure from a missed-grace.

- **Always-on failure ring buffer (independent of DEBUG_MODE).** New `fredy:debug:failures` KV key holds the last 30 publish failures with full error + stage + plugin + slot info. 7-day TTL. Writes happen on every failure path via the new `SchedulerService.recordFailure()` method. This is separate from the existing `fredy:debug:errors` ring buffer (which only writes when DEBUG_MODE=true) so it works in production by default. Read via `container.scheduler.getRecentFailures()`, cleared via `container.scheduler.clearFailures()`.

- **Manager UI — ❌ Failed badge is now clickable.** On the Strategy page Daily Plan table, clicking a `❌ Failed` or `🔄 Failed/Backup` badge opens an alert with the full error details: status, scheduled time, category, provider, error message, failed stage, plugin attempted, and failure timestamp. The plan is cached in `window._lastPlan` when `loadStrategy()` runs so the click handler can read it synchronously.

- **Manager UI — Logs tab now shows a Publish Failures section.** A red-bordered card at the top of the Logs tab displays the always-on failure ring buffer as a table (Time, Slot, Cat, Stage, Plugin, Error) plus a collapsible raw JSON view. A "Clear" button lets the admin wipe the buffer. The existing Errors and Updates sections remain, with a note explaining they only populate when DEBUG_MODE=true.

- **Manager API — new endpoints:**
  - `GET /Manager/api/logs` now returns `failures` field alongside `updates` and `errors`.
  - `POST /Manager/api/clear/failures` clears the failure ring buffer.

- **Admin PM notifications strengthened.** `notifyAdminOfFailure()` now accepts an optional `errorInfo` parameter and includes `🩺 Failed stage:` and `🔌 Plugin attempted:` blockquote rows in the PM when known. The `❌ POST FAILED` notice (when all fallbacks fail) now also includes the original plugin and content ID for triage.

- **Container wiring.** `SchedulerServiceDeps` has a new optional `kv` field, wired in `src/container.ts`. Used only for the failure ring buffer. Backward compatible — tests that don't pass `kv` simply skip the failure buffer.

### How to debug a failed scheduled post (v9.2.3 workflow)

1. Open `/Manager` → Strategy tab.
2. Find the row with `❌ Failed` badge.
3. Click the badge — an alert shows the exact error message, pipeline stage, plugin attempted, and timestamp.
4. For a fuller history, open the Logs tab — the `❌ Publish Failures` card lists the last 30 failures with the same info in table form.
5. The admin PM should also have arrived with the same error details (check Telegram).
6. Compare with manual publish (admin bot → manual trigger for the same plugin) — if manual works but scheduled fails, the issue is in the queue dequeue / stale-language / fallback path, not the publish itself.

### Housekeeping

- `core/constants.ts`: `APP_VERSION = "9.2.3"`, `APP_BUILD_DATE = "2026-07-19"`.
- `package.json`: `version: "9.2.3"`.
- `VERSION` file: `9.2.3`.
- All 134 existing tests pass (41 scheduler + 34 strategy + 41 pipeline + 18 dedup). TypeScript 0 errors.

## [9.2.2] — 2026-07-19 — Revert extra cron, move stale-tick into tick.ts (minimal-trigger design)

### Critical Fix — Reverts v9.2.1's `*/30 * * * *` cron

- **Reverted the v9.2.1 30-minute cron trigger.** Adding a third trigger
  violated the project's minimal-trigger design philosophy. Per the user's
  correction: even though a single `kv.get` is cheap, *trigger count itself*
  is a resource that should be minimised on a free-tier project. The right
  place for stale-tick detection is inside the existing 2-hourly tick —
  zero new triggers, zero extra KV writes on the happy path.

### Replacement — Stale-tick detection moved into `tick.ts`

- **`src/entry/tick.ts`** now reads `fredy:tick:lastTick` *before*
  overwriting it. If the gap exceeds `STALE_TICK_GAP_HOURS` (5h — i.e.
  at least 2 missed cycles), it schedules a background admin PM via
  `ctx.waitUntil(notifyStaleTick(...))`. Cost on the happy path:
  **1 extra KV READ per tick, 0 extra KV writes**. The write + TG send
  only happen in the rare case of a real gap, and a 6h cooldown
  (`fredy:tick:lastStaleAlert`) suppresses repeat alerts.
- **Detection latency trade-off:** alerts fire when the service *recovers*,
  not at the moment of failure. Worst case: cron-job.org goes down for 3h,
  comes back, the admin gets the alert ~3h late. This is acceptable for a
  free-tier project that values minimal triggers over real-time alerts.
- **Complementary (free, outside Cloudflare):** cron-job.org has a built-in
  "alert me if this job doesn't run" feature on their dashboard. Enabling
  it gives instant failure detection with zero code, zero KV. Recommended.
- **`src/entry/cron.ts`** — `cronHandler` now only handles the `0 0 * * *`
  24-hour backup branch. The `*/30 * * * *` branch and the `checkStaleTick`
  function are removed. The daily 24h backup cron still runs the full tick
  as a safety net (unchanged from v8.10.3).
- **`wrangler.toml`** — `crons` reverted to `["0 0 * * *"]`. Single
  internal cron trigger, exactly as originally designed.

### Verification — Box-drawing cover UI for admin PMs

- Confirmed that all admin PM notifications still use the box-drawing
  `━━━ ✅ TITLE ━━━` banner followed by `<blockquote>` rows for each
  detail field. This is the cover UI that was debugged and fixed in an
  earlier pass. Verified present in:
  - `notifyAdminPm()` — success/failure notice after auto-publish
    (`━━━ 🤖 📤 AUTO-PUBLISHED POST ━━━`, `━━━ ✅ AUTO-PUBLISHED ━━━`,
    `━━━ ❌ AUTO-PUBLISH FAILED ━━━`)
  - `notifyAdminOfFailure()` — pipeline failure notice
    (`━━━ ⚠️ SCHEDULED POST FAILED ━━━`)
  - Backup-post notice (`━━━ 🔄 BACKUP POST PUBLISHED ━━━`)
  - KV quota notice (`━━━ ⚠️ KV QUOTA EXCEEDED ━━━`)
  - New stale-tick notice (`━━━ ⚠️ STALE TICK ALERT ━━━`) — same style
    for visual consistency.

### Housekeeping

- `core/constants.ts`: `APP_VERSION = "9.2.2"`.
- `package.json`: `version: "9.2.2"`.
- `VERSION` file: `9.2.2`.
- `wrangler.toml`: cron section reverted and re-documented.

## [9.2.1] — 2026-07-19 — Stale-tick watchdog cron, refreshSources() cleanup, dedup comments, Queue page refactor

### Critical Fixes

- **Stale-tick detection latency reduced from "next midnight" to ~30 minutes.**
  Added a dedicated lightweight Cloudflare cron `*/30 * * * *` that performs a
  single KV read of `fredy:tick:lastTick`. If the external cron hasn't registered
  a tick in 4 hours, it sends a single admin PM and records a cooldown timestamp
  (`fredy:tick:lastStaleAlert`, 2h TTL) so subsequent stale fires within that
  window are suppressed — no PM spam. Cheap by design: zero writes when fresh,
  one KV write + one Telegram send only when stale AND outside the cooldown
  window. The 24h backup cron (`0 0 * * *`) also runs this check as belt-and-
  braces. `wrangler.toml` `crons` array updated to `["0 0 * * *", "*/30 * * * *"]`.
  `src/entry/cron.ts` `cronHandler` now branches on `event.cron` for the two
  expressions and warns on unknown expressions instead of silently returning.

- **Removed dead `refreshSources()` pathway and its pointless KV write.**
  `SchedulerOrchestrator.refreshSources()` was a no-op stub (TODO never
  implemented) whose caller in `tick.ts` (`refreshSourcesIfNeeded()`) still
  paid a KV write every ~2 hours for `fredy:tick:lastRefresh` — a real write
  for a feature that did nothing. Source fetching is already covered by
  `content.processForCategory()` inside `maintainQueue()`, so the entire
  pathway was dead weight. Removed: `refreshSources()` method,
  `refreshSourcesIfNeeded()` function, `REFRESH_KEY` constant, the
  `await scheduler.refreshSources()` call inside the 24h cron branch, the
  `lastRefresh` card on the dashboard, and the `lastRefresh` field in the
  `/Manager/api/health` response.

- **Deleted contradictory comment block in `duplicate-detector.ts`.** The
  v8.10.0 comment that described "URL dedup skipped, hash is sufficient,
  TODO: store a separate URL→hash index" was left in place after v9.2.0
  restored URL dedup — directly contradicting the code a few lines above it.
  Removed the misleading comment block entirely. Also cleaned up the
  "Removed isGenericApiUrl..." stale comment that referenced functions which
  now exist again.

### Queue Page Refactor (Manager UI)

- **`loadQueue()` now shows newest items first.** Items are sorted by
  `enqueuedAt` DESC, so freshly enqueued content appears at the top of each
  category table instead of the bottom (root cause of the "recent posts
  aren't shown" report — they were at the bottom of a 50-row table).
- **Added enqueued time + age column.** Each row now shows absolute time
  (`HH:MM:SS`) and relative age (`5m ago`, `2h ago`).
- **Added source URL column** (clickable link, opens in new tab).
- **Added per-category Refresh button** so the admin can pull fresh queue
  state without reloading the whole page.
- **Score is now color-coded** — green ≥80, yellow 60-79, red <60 — same
  convention as the Strategy page.
- **Server-side `listItems()` already filters expired items** (kept that
  behaviour); the API response was extended to include `enqueuedAt`,
  `sourceUrl`, `qualityScore`, `aiProvider`, `aiModel`. Backward compatible
  (existing fields kept).

### Tests

- **New `scripts/test-dedup.ts`** — covers the dedup check/record pair that
  was reworked twice in two versions. Tests: URL match wins over hash,
  hash match catches body-identical items with different URLs, no false
  positives on first-seen items, recording twice is idempotent at the KV
  layer (record is overwritten), URL-with-empty-body falls back to URL+title
  hash so two HackerNews-style items with no body aren't falsely flagged.
  Run with `npx tsx scripts/test-dedup.ts`.

### Housekeeping

- `core/constants.ts`: `APP_VERSION = "9.2.1"`.
- `package.json`: `version: "9.2.1"`.
- `VERSION` file: `9.2.1`.
- `wrangler.toml`: cron section expanded and documented.

## [9.2.0] — 2026-07-18 — KV double-write elimination, queue lock no-op release, URL dedup restoration

### Critical Fixes

- **Eliminated KV double-write in `SchedulerService.markSlotFired`.**
  Previously `markSlotFired` was called for every fired slot, but when the
  strategy engine is wired in, the slot's status is already tracked in the
  strategy plan — so the dailyPlanner write was redundant. Now
  `markSlotFired` only fires when `!strategyEngine` (5 call sites updated).
  Saves 1 KV write per published slot — meaningful on the 1000 writes/day
  free tier.
- **Queue lock release is now a no-op.** `ContentQueue.acquireQueueLock()`
  returned a release function that did a `kv.delete()` — but the lock key
  has a 10s TTL and ticks are <<10s apart, so the delete was almost always
  wasted. Release is now `async () => {}`; the lock expires naturally.
  Saves 1 KV delete per dequeue.
- **Restored URL-based dedup.** v8.10.0 had removed URL dedup entirely,
  citing KV write cost. But cross-plugin duplicates (same URL, different
  body text) were getting through. Restored 2-write dedup: `record()` writes
  both `dedupKey(hash)` and `fredy:dedup:url:<sha1(url)>`; `check()` reads
  both. Title-fuzzy dedup stays removed (was the most expensive, least
  valuable of the three). Net: 2 reads + 2 writes per item, down from 3/3
  pre-v8.10.0 but with cross-plugin protection restored.
- **Stale-tick alert** (initial implementation, ran only on the 24h cron —
  superseded by v9.2.1's 30-min watchdog).
- **`CHANGELOG.md` backfill started** (8.2.0 → 9.1.0 still missing —
  completed in v9.2.1).

---

## [9.1.0] — 2026-07-17 — Strategy engine as single source of truth, markPostBackup state, fallback plugins

### Critical Fixes

- **Strategy plan is now the single source of truth for slot status.**
  `SchedulerService.findDueSlot()` checks `p.status` from
  `strategyEngine.getOrGeneratePlan()` directly, not `dailyPlanner.isSlotFired()`.
  Both the Strategy page and the Scheduler page in the Manager UI read
  `p.status` so they always agree. Eliminates the "shows published in table
  but not sent to channel" class of bugs.
- **4-state status badges.** Posts in the strategy plan carry one of:
  `published`, `failed`, `backup`, `pending`. (Previous 3-state model
  conflated backup with failed, hiding real failures.)
- **Fallback plugins: try one at a time, stop on first success.**
  `fireSlot()` previously tried all fallback plugins for a category in
  parallel — wasteful and racy. Now iterates sequentially, stops on first
  success. Each fallback gets a clean retry budget.
- **Grace period enforced.** Slots more than 30 minutes overdue are marked
  `failed`, not fired — prevents burst-publishing after a scheduler outage.
- **`markPostBackup` introduced.** When the primary publish fails (quality
  gate, sendPhoto error, etc.) the slot is marked `backup` rather than
  `failed`, so it isn't double-counted in failure stats.

---

## [9.0.3] — 2026-07-16 — Strategy plan marks past slots as failed (not pending)

### Critical Fix

- **`StrategyEngine.generatePlan()` now marks past slots as `failed`** at
  generation time, not `pending`. Previous behaviour: if the bot missed
  several slots due to an outage, generating a new plan mid-day would mark
  the missed slots as `pending` — they'd then be picked up by `findDueSlot()`
  and burst-fire. New behaviour: past slots = `failed`, future slots =
  `pending`. This stops burst-publishing after outages and matches what the
  admin already sees in the UI.

---

## [9.0.0] — 2026-07-16 — Strategy Engine introduced

### Architecture

- **`src/services/strategy-engine.ts`** — new service. Generates a daily
  plan keyed `fredy:strategy:plan:<date>` with one entry per scheduled slot.
  Each entry has: `slot`, `category`, `provider`, `priority`, `status`,
  `postId`. The plan is the single source of truth for both scheduling
  decisions and UI rendering.
- **`getOrGeneratePlan()`** reads from KV; if missing or stale, generates
  fresh and persists. Used by both `scheduler.tick()` and the Manager UI's
  Strategy + Scheduler pages.
- **`markPostPublished / markPostFailed / markPostBackup`** update a post's
  status in the persisted plan. Called by `SchedulerService.fireSlot()`.
- **`Container` wiring:** `strategyEngine` added to the container and
  passed as a dep to `SchedulerService`. Existing `dailyPlanner` kept for
  backward compatibility (still used when `strategyEngine` is absent).

---

## [8.10.3] — 2026-07-15 — Cron string fix, every-minute cron removed

### Critical Fix

- **Cron string `0 */24 * * *` is invalid on Cloudflare.** Replaced with
  `0 0 * * *` (midnight UTC daily). The invalid expression was causing
  the 24h backup cron to never fire, leaving only the external cron-job.org
  as the scheduler — a single point of failure.

### Cleanup

- **Removed the every-minute Cloudflare cron branch.** It was unused since
  the external cron took over the 2-hourly tick. Reduces Cloudflare cron
  slot count from 3 to 1 (now 2 again after v9.2.1 added the watchdog).

---

## [8.10.0] — 2026-07-15 — Dedup optimization (single-write), admin PM on KV quota

### KV Optimization

- **Dedup reduced from 3 KV writes per item to 1.** v8.x wrote `dedupKey(hash)`,
  `dedup:url:<urlHash>`, `dedup:title:<titleHash>` for every recorded item.
  This was the #1 consumer of the 1000 writes/day free tier. Consolidated
  to a single record under `dedupKey(hash)` containing `url` + `titleHash`
  fields for matching.
- **Title-fuzzy dedup removed.** Was the most expensive (1 KV read per
  check) and least valuable (similar but not identical posts often got
  falsely flagged). Hash dedup catches the real duplicates.
- **NOTE (v9.2.0):** URL dedup was restored in v9.2.0 — the consolidation
  above let cross-plugin duplicates through. Net is 2 writes per item, not 1.

### Critical Fix

- **Admin PM on KV quota exceeded.** When `content.process()` catches a
  KV quota error, it now sends an immediate admin PM rather than failing
  silently. Previously the bot would just stop publishing with no signal.
- **False "duplicate" report fixed.** When ALL items were genuine
  duplicates, the manager UI's "process duplicated item" path was still
  reporting a false duplicate. Now the report distinguishes all-duplicate
  vs KV-quota vs mixed.

---

## [8.8.0] — 2026-07-14 — Backup status, soul-loader cache, schedule page unification

### Critical Fixes

- **Backup status introduced (initial version).** When publish fails, the
  slot is marked `backup` (not `failed`) so it isn't double-counted.
  Refined in v9.1.0.
- **`soul-loader.ts` is now a module-level cache singleton.** Previously
  each `buildContainer()` call created a new `SoulLoader` instance, which
  re-read `soul.md` from KV on every request — burning reads for a file
  that rarely changes. Now `_cachedSoul` / `_cachedSoulAt` persist across
  `buildContainer()` calls within the same isolate.
- **Schedule page reads strategy plan directly.** `admin/screens/schedule.ts`
  was building the Daily Plan table from `dailyPlanner.getFiredSlots()`,
  causing visible drift vs the Strategy page. Now both pages read
  `strategyEngine.getOrGeneratePlan()`.
- **Schedule page uses real 3-state status from strategy plan.** No longer
  overrides with `scheduler.isSlotFired()`.

---

## [8.7.0] — 2026-07-13 — Real 3-state status, regenerate clears both plans

### Critical Fixes

- **Real 3-state status from strategy plan.** Slot rows in the Manager UI
  Daily Plan table now show `published` / `failed` / `pending` from the
  strategy plan's `p.status` field — not the binary `fired` flag.
- **Regenerate button clears BOTH plans.** Previously clicking Regenerate
  cleared `fredy:sched:slots` but left `fredy:strategy:plan:<date>` intact,
  so the old plan would reappear on next page load. Now both keys are
  deleted atomically before regeneration.

---

## [8.5.0] — 2026-07-12 — Fallback plugin iteration, status() uses strategy plan

### Improvements

- **`status()` uses strategy engine plan when available.** The plan has
  `provider`, `priority`, and `status` fields that the dailyPlanner doesn't
  carry — gives the dashboard richer data.
- **Fallback plugins: try the NEXT plugin, not all at once.** Was wasteful
  (4 parallel pipeline runs on every fallback). Now sequential, stop on
  first success. Refined further in v9.1.0.

### Bug Fix

- **`findDueSlot()` checks strategy plan status directly.** Previously
  checked `dailyPlanner.isSlotFired()` which could disagree with the
  strategy plan, causing slots to be double-fired or skipped.

---

## [8.4.0] — 2026-07-12 — Schedule page strategy plan, fallback plugin helper

### Features

- **Schedule page fetches strategy plan for the Daily Plan table.** Lays
  the groundwork for unifying the Strategy and Scheduler pages.
- **`getFallbackPlugins(category)` helper** in `SchedulerService` — returns
  plugins for a category other than the primary. Used by `fireSlot()` when
  the primary plugin fails or returns no candidates.

---

## [8.3.0] — 2026-07-12 — /start welcome message, bot UI language, CSP

### Features

- **`/start` shows a separate welcome message.** Distinguishes first-run
  onboarding from the main menu. Persists bot UI language at
  `fredy:botui:<adminId>`.
- **Bot UI language flow.** New `botui:open` / `botui:set:<lang>` /
  `botui:back` callback routes in `AdminOrchestrator`.
- **CSP header on /Manager.** Allows inline scripts and eval — the dashboard
  uses template literals and inline `<script>` tags.

---

## [8.2.1] — 2026-07-11 — Strategy engine wiring into scheduler, markPostFailed for strategy plan

### Improvements

- **`strategyEngine` wired into `SchedulerService`.** New optional dep —
  when present, `fireSlot()` calls `markPostPublished` / `markPostFailed`
  on the strategy plan in addition to (not instead of) the dailyPlanner.
- **Failure path marks strategy plan post as failed.** Previously only
  `dailyPlanner.markFailed` was called, leaving the strategy plan showing
  `pending` indefinitely.

---

## [8.2.0] — 2026-07-11 — Strategy mode switch clears plan, scheduler page reads strategy

### Critical Fix

- **When strategy mode changes, clear today's plan + all fired markers.**
  Previously switching from "balanced" to "burst" left the old plan in
  place, causing the new mode to be ignored until the next day. Now the
  /Manager strategy-mode-change handler deletes both `fredy:sched:slots`
  and `fredy:strategy:plan:<date>` and triggers a fresh
  `getOrGeneratePlan()`.

### Features

- **Scheduler page fetches strategy plan too** — unifies with the Strategy
  page's Daily Plan rendering. Both pages now show the same provider,
  priority, and status columns.

---

## [8.1.3] — 2026-07-11 — Admin PM on publish failure, NASA direct mode

### Features

- **Admin PM when a scheduled post fails to publish.** Includes the slot
  time, category, plugin, and error message. Stops the admin having to
  watch the dashboard for failures.
- **NASA direct mode.** `content-manager.process()` bypasses AI entirely
  for `pluginId === "nasa"` — uses the title as the post text, assigns
  score 95, always English. Saves AI calls for content that's already
  editorial-quality.

---

## [8.1.1] — 2026-07-11 — ConfigCache module singleton, batched depth checks

### Performance

- **`ConfigCache` is now a module-level singleton** (`sharedConfigCache`).
  `container.ts` uses the singleton so write-invalidation propagates
  correctly across all `ConfigService` instances within the same isolate.
- **Batched depth checks.** `maintainQueue()` uses `queue.depth()` once
  instead of `depthFor(cat)` per category. Reduces 3 KV reads to 1.

---

## [8.1.0] — v8.1.0 — Re-applied v8 fixes (timezone, locks, dedup, admin screens, Manager onclick escaping)

### Overview

This release re-applies the v8.0.0 + v8.1.0 fixes that were lost when the working directory was reverted to v7.1.1. All 28 fixes from the v8 series are reapplied in one consolidated release. No new features beyond what v8.0.0/v8.1.0 already shipped.

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Timezone bug in `time-generator.ts`** — the `minutesToEpochMs` method previously ignored the configured timezone (used `Date.UTC()` directly). Now computes the timezone offset via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` and applies it correctly so slots fire at the intended local time.
- **Concurrent tick races** — extracted a shared `acquireTickLock()` helper (`src/services/tick-lock.ts`) and switched both `tick.ts` and `cron.ts` to use it. The 24h backup cron and the minute cron no longer fight each other for the lock.
- **Per-category queue lock** — `ContentQueue.dequeue()` now wraps in a per-category KV lock (10s TTL, 30 attempts) so two concurrent ticks can't dequeue the same item.
- **30-minute grace period in `SchedulerService.findDueSlot()`** — slots more than 30 minutes overdue are marked as "passed" instead of firing, preventing burst-publishing after a scheduler outage.
- **CREDIBILITY_SCORES keys** — fixed to match real plugin IDs (`github`, `devto`, `stackexchange`, `nasa`, `xkcd`, `wikimedia`, `news`, `hackernews`, `github-releases`, `github-trending`) instead of URLs.
- **`duplicate-detector.ts` `hashUrl`** — replaced djb2 with SHA-1 (via `sha1()`) to eliminate collisions on similar URLs. All callers updated to `await` the result.
- **Manager dashboard onclick escaping** — fixed all broken `\\''` patterns in `src/entry/manager.ts` template literal. Both variable-arg (`navigate`, `postToChannel`, `copyText`, `testPlugin`, `togglePlugin`, `deleteQueueItem`, `testAIModel`, `switchStrategy`, `copyElement`) and literal-id arg cases now render correctly in the browser.

### skipEnqueue option (Content Pipeline)

- Added `skipEnqueue?: boolean` to `ContentManager.process()`, `processForCategory()`, `processFromPlugin()` option bags.
- All enqueue calls are guarded by `if (!skipEnqueue)`.
- `SchedulerService.fireSlot()` passes `{ skipEnqueue: true }` when generating fresh content (the slot itself is publishing, no need to also queue).
- `SchedulerService.manualPublish()` passes `{ skipEnqueue: true }` to all `process*` calls.
- `admin/screens/manual.ts` passes `{ skipEnqueue: true }` to all manual triggers.

### UX Layer (Telegram Post Formatting)

- `assembleFullText` and `assembleCaption` now take explicit `maxLen` params (`TELEGRAM_TEXT_LIMIT`, `TELEGRAM_CAPTION_LIMIT`).
- Pre-truncate body: try full body first, only truncate if the assembled text exceeds the limit. Reserve space for hook + footer + overhead.
- New `summarizeText()` method truncates at paragraph boundary first, then sentence boundary, then word boundary, with `…` marker.
- Removed the old `safeTruncate()` HTML-tag-closing helper (no longer needed — we truncate the raw body before HTML conversion).

### Admin Panel: New Screens & Routing

- New `languageScreen` (`src/admin/screens/language.ts`) — edits `settings.language.default` with callbacks `set:language:default:<en|fa|auto>` and `set:language:autodetect:toggle`.
- New `strategyScreen` (`src/admin/screens/strategy.ts`) — switches strategy mode via `set:strategy:mode:<mode>`.
- `mainScreen` now has Language and Strategy nav buttons, plus a Manager URL button (reads from `ctx.container.env.MANAGER_URL`).
- `mainScreen.keyboard()` now accepts an optional `ctx` parameter (needed for env access). All call sites updated to pass `ctx`.
- `Screen` interface updated: `keyboard(settings, ctx?)` now accepts the optional context.
- `/start` command now persists bot UI language in KV at `fredy:botui:<adminId>` (separate from post language).
- `AdminOrchestrator.handleCallback()` now sends a `sendChatAction("typing")` at the start of every callback.
- `AdminOrchestrator` routes `botui:*` callbacks (stores bot UI lang in KV), `set:language:*` → language screen, `set:strategy:*` → strategy screen.

### Type Fixes

- `types/scheduler.ts`: Added `fired?: boolean` to `SlotTime` (set by `status()` for the dashboard).
- `types/telegram.ts`: `callback_data` is now optional in `InlineKeyboardButton` (URL buttons don't have it).
- `types/env.ts`: Added `MANAGER_URL?: string` after `SCHEDULE_JITTER_MINUTES`.
- `scheduler-service.ts`: `escapeHtml` removed from the class (single source of truth in `primitives/strings.ts`), all `this.escapeHtml(...)` calls replaced with `escapeHtml(...)`.
- `scheduler-service.ts`: `status()` now annotates each slot with `fired` state via `dailyPlanner.isSlotFired()`.

### Container / Config Cache

- `ConfigCache` now exports a module-level singleton `sharedConfigCache`.
- `container.ts` uses `sharedConfigCache` instead of `new ConfigCache()` so write-invalidation propagates correctly across all `ConfigService` instances within the same isolate.

### Admin Screens — Manual Publish UX

- `admin/screens/manual.ts` now wraps each manual pipeline run in a `setInterval(() => sendChatAction("typing"), 4000)` so the admin sees a live "typing…" indicator while the AI pipeline runs (which can take 10-30s). The interval is cleared in a `finally` block.

### Config

- `wrangler.toml`: Added `MANAGER_URL = "https://fredy-admin.iliv007-34b.workers.dev/Manager"` in `[vars]`.
- `core/constants.ts`: `APP_VERSION = "8.1.0"`.
- `VERSION` file: `8.1.0`.
- `package.json`: `version: "8.1.0"`.

### Documentation

- Deleted stale `ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md` (was misleading and out of sync with the actual code).

## [7.0.4] — 2026-07-16 — Phase 4: Manager Dashboard & Runtime Control

### Overview

Fourth and final phase of the v7 roadmap. The Manager Dashboard has been upgraded to a full Mission Control interface with 15 pages, new API endpoints, and real-time runtime configuration.

### New Dashboard Pages (3 new)

1. **Strategy Page** (`🎯 Strategy`) — switch between 6 strategy modes (Minimal, Balanced, Active, AI Priority, News Priority, Custom). View the daily publish plan with posts, times, categories, providers, priorities, and validation results. Regenerate plan on demand. Edit custom distribution (A/B/C counts) when Custom mode is selected.

2. **Debug Page** (`🐞 Debug`) — developer tools showing: runtime config (scheduler, strategy, AI, language), last tick log (structured), last pipeline log (structured), cache stats, KV health, and secrets status (configured/missing only — never values).

3. **Settings Page** (`🔧 Settings`) — editable runtime configuration with form inputs for: language (auto/fa/en), quality threshold, min gap, refresh interval, quiet hours start/end. Save button applies changes immediately via `POST /Manager/api/settings`. No redeployment required.

### Enhanced Existing Pages

- **Scheduler Page** — added controls: Pause/Resume Scheduler, Force Publish, posting windows display, quiet hours display, lock timeout display, min gap display.

- **Dashboard** — nav expanded to 15 items (was 12). Strategy, Debug, Settings added.

### New API Endpoints (8)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/Manager/api/strategy` | GET | Get strategy config + daily plan |
| `/Manager/api/strategy` | POST | Update strategy mode/config |

| `/Manager/api/debug` | GET | Runtime config, tick log, pipeline log, secrets |
| `/Manager/api/scheduler/force-publish` | POST | Force a scheduler tick |
| `/Manager/api/scheduler/pause` | POST | Pause scheduler |
| `/Manager/api/scheduler/resume` | POST | Resume scheduler |
| `/Manager/api/settings` | POST | Update runtime settings (language, quality, etc.) |

### Files Changed (5)

1. `VERSION` → 7.0.4
2. `package.json` → 7.0.4
3. `src/core/constants.ts` → APP_VERSION = "7.0.4"
4. `src/entry/manager.ts` — 8 new API endpoints + 3 new dashboard pages + enhanced scheduler page
5. `CHANGELOG.md` → this entry

## [7.0.3] — 2026-07-16 — Phase 3: Smart Content Pipeline & Quality Engine

### Overview

Third phase of the v7 roadmap. The content pipeline has been enhanced with 4 new modular stages that run BEFORE AI, minimizing token usage and improving post quality.

### New Modules (4)

1. **FreshnessFilter** (`src/services/freshness-filter.ts`) — rejects stale content before AI:
   - News (Category B): max 48h old
   - NASA APOD: max 7 days old, rejects future dates
   - General: max 7 days old
   - All thresholds configurable

2. **ContentEnricher** (`src/services/content-enricher.ts`) — enriches content WITHOUT AI (user's suggestion):
   - GitHub: fetches stars, forks, language, license, topics from GitHub REST API
   - HackerNews: fetches score, comments, author from Firebase API
   - NASA: ensures title, date, explanation are complete
   - Runs AFTER dedup, BEFORE AI — so AI works on richer data at no extra token cost

3. **CandidateRanker** (`src/services/candidate-ranker.ts`) — scores candidates locally (0–100):
   - Freshness (15%): newer = better
   - Credibility (20%): known sources score higher
   - Content length (10%): optimal range
   - Image availability (10%): has image = bonus
   - Technical relevance (15%): matches tech keywords
   - Category priority (10%): A > B > C
   - Trending score (20%): stars/score/reactions
   - Only top-ranked candidates sent to AI

4. **PipelineLogger** (`src/services/pipeline-logger.ts`) — structured pipeline logging:
   - Records each stage (normalize, validate, freshness, dedup, enrich, rank, AI, format)
   - Captures: provider, ranking score, AI provider/model, quality score, queue depth, errors
   - Last pipeline log stored in KV for dashboard

### Pipeline Architecture (v7)

```
Provider → Normalizer → Local Validation → Freshness Filter → Duplicate Detection
    → Content Enrichment → Category Resolve → Candidate Ranking
    → AI Quality Review → Humanizer → Telegram Formatter → Queue
```

Each stage is independent and isolated. If one fails, the pipeline continues when possible.

### Files Changed (12)

1. `VERSION` → 7.0.3
2. `package.json` → 7.0.3
3. `src/core/constants.ts` → APP_VERSION = "7.0.3"
4. `src/services/freshness-filter.ts` — NEW: freshness filter
5. `src/services/content-enricher.ts` — NEW: content enricher (no AI)
6. `src/services/candidate-ranker.ts` — NEW: local candidate ranking
7. `src/services/pipeline-logger.ts` — NEW: structured pipeline logging
8. `src/services/content-manager.ts` — pipeline refactored with 4 new stages
9. `src/container.ts` — wires new modules
10. `src/types/env.ts` — adds new modules to Container
11. `scripts/test-pipeline.ts` — NEW: 41 unit tests

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✅ 0 errors |
| Scheduler tests | ✅ 41 passed |
| Strategy tests | ✅ 34 passed |
| Pipeline tests | ✅ 41 passed |
| Total tests | ✅ 116 passed, 0 failed |
| Regression | None |

## [7.0.2] — 2026-07-16 — Phase 2: Strategy Engine & Content Planning

### Overview

Second phase of the v7 roadmap. The Strategy Engine is the brain of Fredy's content planning system. It decides what to publish, when, which providers to use, and which categories to prioritize — without directly publishing any content.

### New Features

- **Strategy Engine** (`src/services/strategy-engine.ts`) — independent module that generates `DailyPublishPlan` objects. The Scheduler consumes these plans. The engine never interacts with Telegram.

- **6 Built-in Strategies**:
  | Mode | A | B | C | Total | Notes |
  |------|---|---|---|-------|-------|
  | Minimal | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | Low activity |
  | Balanced (default) | 4 | 2 | 3 | 9 | Normal operation |
  | Active | 6 | 3 | 4 | 13 | High activity |
  | AI Priority | 5 | 1 | 2 | 8 | Quality threshold 80 |
  | News Priority | 3 | 5 | 2 | 10 | Fast tech updates |
  | Custom | configurable | configurable | configurable | configurable | Admin-defined |

- **Weekly Themes** — 7 daily themes that influence provider selection:
  - Monday: AI, Open Source, GitHub
  - Tuesday: Frameworks, Libraries, Developer Tools
  - Wednesday: Cloud, Backend, DevOps
  - Thursday: Security, Networking, Infrastructure
  - Friday: Machine Learning, Research, NASA
  - Saturday: Open Source, Community, Projects
  - Sunday: Light Content, Quotes, XKCD, Developer Facts

- **Priority System** — each planned post gets a priority level:
  - High: Category A (core dev content), Category B in news_priority mode
  - Normal: Category B (default)
  - Low: Category C (support content)

- **DailyPublishPlan** — complete plan stored in KV with:
  - Planned posts (time, category, provider, strategy, language, priority, queue target, status)
  - Strategy mode used
  - Weekly theme for the day
  - Category distribution
  - Validation result (errors + warnings)

- **Plan Validation** — before saving, the engine validates:
  - No duplicate providers consecutively
  - No duplicate categories more than twice in a row
  - Posts respect quiet hours
  - Posts respect minimum gap
  - At least one post exists

## [7.0.1] — 2026-07-16 — Phase 1: Scheduler Core Refactor

### Overview

First phase of the v7 roadmap. The scheduler has been refactored into a modular, queue-first, runtime-configurable architecture with quiet hours, posting windows, and structured logging.

### New Features

- **Quiet Hours** — configurable period (default 00:00–07:30) during which no posts are published. If a tick fires during quiet hours, the scheduler skips with a clear reason. Supports midnight-spanning periods (e.g., 22:00–07:30). New `QuietHoursChecker` module handles the logic.

- **Posting Windows** — replaces fixed slot times with configurable windows. Each window generates ONE random publish time per day. Default windows:
  - Morning: 08:00–10:00
  - Noon: 12:00–14:00
  - Afternoon: 16:00–18:00
  - Evening: 18:00–20:00
  - Night: 20:00–22:00

- **Structured Tick Logging** — new `TickLogger` and `TickLogBuilder` modules. Every tick produces a structured `TickLog` entry with: tick ID, start/end timestamps, duration, lock status, published/skipped counts, queue depths, refresh status, errors, quiet hours status. Last tick log is stored in KV for dashboard display.

- **Runtime-Configurable Lock Timeout** — the distributed lock timeout is now loaded from `scheduler.lockTimeoutSec` (default 90s). Previously hardcoded.

- **Runtime-Configurable Min Gap** — `scheduler.minGapMinutes` (default 90) controls the minimum gap between posts. Previously hardcoded.

- **Publishing Mode** — new `scheduler.publishingMode` field: `"auto"` (default), `"manual"`, or `"scheduled"`.

- **Scheduler Config v2** — `_version` bumped to 2. New fields: `quietHours`, `lockTimeoutSec`, `minGapMinutes`, `publishingMode`. Default `postingWindows` populated with 5 windows (was empty array).

- **Unit Tests** — 41 tests covering QuietHoursChecker (isQuietHours, midnight-spanning, deferPastQuietHours), TimeGenerator (within windows, one-per-window, minGap, empty distribution, more-categories-than-windows), and TickLogBuilder. All pass.

## [6.9.0] — 2026-07-16 — Full Debug Pass: 0 TypeScript Errors + Quality Gate Fix + Anti-Repeat + Code Consolidation

### Critical: TypeScript Errors — 33 → 0

- **All 33 TypeScript errors fixed** — `npx tsc --noEmit` now exits with code 0 (zero errors). This was the most critical finding from the debug audit: the project's own `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` requires zero errors, but 33 errors had been carried across multiple releases (v6.5.1 → v6.7.0 → v6.7.1 → v6.8.0) without being addressed.

  Fixes applied:
  - **tsconfig.json**: excluded `scripts/` from the main type-check (scripts use Node.js APIs like `node:test` and `process` which require `@types/node`, not `@cloudflare/workers-types`). Scripts are standalone tools, not Worker code.
  - **section-registry.ts**: `migrated` typed as `unknown` with explicit cast to `Record<string, unknown>`.
  - **config-service.ts**: all `FredySettings` ↔ `Record<string, unknown>` conversions now go through `unknown` first (`as unknown as FredySettings`).
  - **emoji-rotator.ts**: `bestEmoji` typed as `string` explicitly.
  - **enrichment-engine.ts, hook-engine.ts, media-handler.ts, tagging-system.ts**: unused `deps` constructor params renamed to `_deps` with `void _deps`.
  - **logger.ts**: removed unused `DebugLogLevel` import.
  - **prompt-builder.ts**: `Soul` imported from `types/ai` (not `soul-loader` which doesn't export it).
  - **source-formatter.ts**: unused `emoji` and `state` params prefixed with `_`.
  - **types/content.ts**: added `tags?: readonly string[]` to `ProviderEnrichment` (was missing, causing enrichment-engine errors).
  - **enrichment-engine.ts**: `publishDate: null` → `publishDate: undefined` (type is `number | undefined`).

### Critical: Quality Gate — No Longer Wastes AI Tokens

- **Low-quality content is now rejected immediately, not enqueued** — previously, when AI quality was below threshold, the content was enqueued with a fake `passed: true` field. This wasted a queue slot and AI tokens: the content would later be rejected by `finalPublisher` anyway. Now `content-manager.ts` Stage 8 rejects immediately via `this.reject(...)`, so the caller (`processForCategory`) can try the next source item instead of wasting the slot.

### Critical: Anti-Repeat AI Mechanism Now Active

- **`recentHashes` now loaded from KV** — the `TODO: load from KV in Phase 8` comment is gone. `AIService` now:
  1. Loads the last 50 AI content hashes from KV (`fredy:ai:recent-hashes`).
  2. Passes them to `QualityEngine.evaluate()` as `recentHashes`.
  3. If quality passes, records the new hash back to KV (TTL 7 days).
  This prevents the AI from generating near-duplicate content on consecutive ticks.

### Critical: Version Sync

- **All version sources now synchronized** — `VERSION` file, `src/core/constants.ts` (`APP_VERSION`), `package.json` (`"version"`), and `CHANGELOG.md` all say `6.9.0`. Previously `package.json` was stuck at `6.2.0` and `wrangler.toml` had a misleading `Version: 1.4.0` comment.

### Caption Truncation Fix

- **Caption body now uses HTML-aware truncation** — `assembleCaption()` previously used `body.slice(0, 797)` which could cut mid-HTML-tag. Now uses `this.safeTruncate(body, 797)` which closes open tags. This prevents broken HTML in image captions.

### Code Consolidation

- **`escapeHtml` consolidated to single source** — previously had 3 separate implementations: `primitives/strings.ts`, `admin/helpers/formatting.ts`, and a private method in `ux-layer.ts`. Now `primitives/strings.ts` is the single source of truth (handles null/undefined, escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`). The other two import and re-export it. `ux-layer.ts` uses the imported function directly (removed its private method).

### Documentation Fixes

- **`cron.ts` comment updated** — was "Single cron (every 5 minutes)" from an old version. Now accurately describes the architecture: external cron-job.org every 2 hours (primary) + Cloudflare internal cron every 24 hours (backup). Includes a SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE warning.
- **`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` updated** — added version-sync check, scheduling/operational risks section (external cron, backup cron, uptime monitor recommendation, dedup clear after upgrade).
- **`fixPersianHalfSpaces` comment fixed** — was "Stub — real impl in Phase 1.4" but the implementation was already there. Now accurately describes what it does.

## [6.8.0] — 2026-07-16 — Fix Truncation + NASA Photos + Wikimedia Filter + Plugin Toggle

### Critical Fixes

- **Post truncation fixed (source/footer cut off mid-word)** — root cause: `stripBareUrls()` and `formatBody()` used `\x00` (null byte) as placeholder delimiters. Telegram's API truncates messages at null bytes, causing the source link and channel footer to be cut off mid-word (e.g., "soru" instead of "Source"). Fix: replaced all `\x00` placeholders with string-based placeholders (`__FREDY_LINK_0__`, `__FREDY_CODE_0__`) that Telegram handles correctly. Also removed `.trim()` from `stripBareUrls()` which could remove trailing newlines between blockquotes.

- **NASA images now sent as photos (not links)** — root cause: the NASA plugin used `hdurl` (HD resolution) for the image URL. NASA HD images can be 5-10MB, which Telegram's `sendPhoto` rejects (5MB limit for URL-based photos). When `sendPhoto` failed, the code fell through to text-only, showing the image URL as a link. Fix: use `url` (standard resolution, ~1024px) instead of `hdurl`. Standard resolution is perfect for Telegram and loads fast.

- **Wikimedia filter much stricter** — root cause: the `isTechRelated()` function checked `event.text` + `pageTitles` + `pageCategories`. Wikipedia categories are extremely broad and contain tech keywords in unexpected places, causing false positives (e.g., "Battle of Spercheios" — a 10th century Byzantine battle — passed the filter because a Wikipedia category contained a tech keyword). Fix: only check `event.text` (the one-line description), use word-boundary regex matching (`\bkeyword\b`) instead of substring matching, and skip categories entirely. This ensures only events that explicitly mention tech topics in their description pass the filter.

### Added

- **Plugin enable/disable toggle in Manager dashboard** — the Plugins page now has a "Disable"/"Enable" button next to each plugin (in addition to the existing "Test" button). Clicking it calls `POST /Manager/api/plugin/<id>/toggle` which calls `pluginManager.enable(id)` or `pluginManager.disable(id)`. The toggle state persists in KV (via `pluginManager.updateStatus`). This allows the admin to quickly disable problematic APIs (e.g., Wikimedia) without redeploying.

## [6.7.1] — 2026-07-16 — Fix: Empty-Body Hash Collision (HackerNews all-duplicates bug)

### Critical Fix

- **Empty-body items no longer falsely detected as duplicates** — root cause: `DuplicateDetector.computeHash()` hashed `item.body` with SHA-1. When body was empty (common for HackerNews link stories that only have a title), `sha1("")` returned the same hash for every empty-body item. This meant once the first HN post was published, every subsequent HN post with an empty body was falsely detected as a duplicate of the first one — blocking all HN posts from being published.

  **Fix**: `computeHash()` now checks if the normalized body is shorter than 3 chars. If so, it falls back to hashing `url + title` (prefixed with `fallback:` so it never collides with a real body hash). This ensures each empty-body item gets a unique hash based on its URL and title.

  This also affects other plugins that may have empty bodies (e.g., some StackExchange questions, some Dev.to articles with only a description).

## [6.7.0] — 2026-07-15 — Quality Reject to Admin PM + Topic Filters + Shorter NASA Captions + Code Blocks

### Critical Fixes

- **Quality-rejected posts now sent to admin PM in raw form** — when a post fails the quality gate (score < threshold) or publish validation, the formatted post is now sent to the admin PM with a "⚠️ Post REJECTED" notice. The admin can see what was rejected and forward it to the channel manually if they want it published. Previously, rejected posts just returned an error JSON with no admin visibility. This applies to the manual publish path (Manager dashboard → Post to Channel).

- **NASA videos now kept (not skipped)** — the NASA plugin previously skipped video APOD entries. Now it keeps both image AND video APODs. The user said "اگه ناسا ویدیو هم باشه که قشنگ باشه اوکیه". Video posts are sent as text/link posts (no photo); image posts are sent as photo posts.

- **NASA captions now much shorter** — Category C prompt rewritten to enforce 1-2 SHORT lines (≤150 chars total). Added a HARD RULE: "total text must be ≤150 chars". Includes a good example ("🌟 سحابی شکارچی در فاصله ۱۳۰۰ سال نوری...") and a bad example (multi-paragraph physics). This addresses "هنوز مقدار تکست های پیام هاش به دو سه خط نرسیده!"

- **Wikimedia topic filter made much stricter** — the previous tech keyword list included overly broad terms like "science", "engineer", "data", "space" that let through unrelated articles (e.g., stratovolcano matched "science"). The new list is strictly computer science / software / dev / electronics: programming languages, web technologies, operating systems, tech companies, hardware, AI/ML, networking/security, databases, robotics, NASA missions. This addresses "پست های ویکی مدیا هم باید فیلتر کنی تا فقط مطالب تکنولوژی جذاب به بات برسن".

- **Dev.to now exposes reactions/comments in metadata** — the DevToArticle interface now includes `public_reactions_count`, `comments_count`, `positive_reactions_count`. These are stored in `item.metadata.reactions` and `item.metadata.comments` so the PopularityFilter can use them.

- **PopularityFilter now has `meetsMinScore` for HN/StackExchange/Dev.to** — hard floors applied on top of the log-based popularity score:
  - HackerNews: min 50 points
  - StackExchange: min 5 score (was 1, now stricter)
  - Dev.to: min 50 reactions
  This addresses "برای هکر نیوز، دیو ای او و... هم فیلتر هایی که میشه بزار!".

- **Telegram formatting now supports code blocks + inline code** — the UX layer's `formatBody()` now converts:
  - ` ```code block``` ` → `<pre><code>code block</code></pre>`
  - `` `inline code` `` → `<code>inline code</code>`
  - `*italic*` → `<i>italic</i>` (NEW)
  - Code is extracted before escaping so `<` `>` `&` inside code display literally.
  This fixes the Rust 1.97.0 post where `Result<T, Uninhabited>` and `dead_code_pub_in_binary` showed as plain text.

- **AI prompt now includes CODE FORMATTING section** — the base system prompt instructs the AI to wrap technical identifiers (shell commands, type names, file paths, lint rule names, env vars, code with special chars) in backticks.

- **AI response schema validation made lenient for `notes`** — previously, if the AI returned `notes` as null/array/object, the whole response was rejected with "Schema validation failed: notes must be a string if present". Now `notes` is coerced to a string (arrays joined with "; ", objects JSON-stringified). This was the root cause of the wikimedia quality score 1 / format-only fallback in the user's example.

## [6.5.1] — 2026-07-15 — Admin PM Notification Fix + Duplicate Post Forwarding + Code Cleanup

### Critical Fixes

- **Auto-published posts now ALWAYS notify admin PM (success or failure)** — `SchedulerService.notifyAdminPm()` was previously gated by `if (result.ok)`, which meant queued posts that failed quality gate / sendPhoto / sendMessage silently disappeared with zero admin visibility. Now the admin PM is notified in all cases:
  - On success: formatted post (photo or text) + summary (slot, AI provider/model, quality, tokens, channel message ID).
  - On failure: formatted post (for manual forwarding) + error notice with the failure reason.
  - If `sendPhoto` fails: automatic fallback to text-only.
  - If `transform` fails: minimal plain-text notice with headline + URL.
  - If everything fails: at least the summary notification goes out (it's the last thing attempted, wrapped in its own `.catch()`).

- **Duplicate posts now send the FORMATTED POST itself to admin PM** — the previous behavior only sent a notice with a `/force_url` command that never actually worked. Now when a manual post is detected as a duplicate:
  1. The pipeline re-processes the item with `skipDedup: true` to get a full `ReadyContent`.
  2. The exact same formatted post (photo or text) that would have gone to the channel is sent to admin PM.
  3. A "🔁 Duplicate detected" notice follows with item info + match reason.
  4. The admin can simply **forward** the post to the channel if they want it published.

  This is much simpler than the broken `/force_url` command — just forward.

### Code Cleanup (debug pass)

- **30 TypeScript errors fixed** — `src/` error count went from 51 (v6.5.0) down to 21 (v6.5.1). Remaining errors are type-system only (FredySettings ↔ Record<string,unknown> conversions, emoji-rotator literal-type narrowing) and have no runtime impact.

- **17 unused-import warnings removed** — `TS6133` warnings are now 0. Cleaned up unused identifiers in `debug.ts`, `settings.ts`, `nasa/index.ts`, `ai-service.ts`, `hook-engine.ts`, `quality-engine.ts`, `source-formatter.ts`, `providers.ts`, `soul.ts`, `orchestrators/admin.ts`, `content-formatter.ts`, `content-normalizer.ts`, `kv-store.ts`, `time.ts`, `config-service.ts`.

- **Plugin manifests now properly exported** — all 13 source plugins (`github`, `devto`, `stackexchange`, `reddit`, `github-releases`, `news`, `hackernews`, `nasa`, `joke`, `xkcd`, `github-trending`, `wikimedia`) now `export { fooManifest } from "./manifest"` in addition to importing it. This resolves the `TS2459` errors in `plugins/sources/index.ts`.

- **`action is used before being assigned` fix** — `orchestrators/admin.ts` line 116: `let action: ScreenAction | void = undefined;` (was uninitialized). This was a latent bug that could have caused runtime issues if `screen.onCallback` ever threw synchronously.

- **New debug events** added to `DebugEventName`:
  - `scheduler.transform_failed` — when `uxLayer.transform()` throws during admin PM notification.
  - `scheduler.send_formatted_failed` — when `sendPhoto`/`sendMessage` fails during admin PM notification.
  - `scheduler.admin_pm_failed` — when the entire `notifyAdminPm` flow fails.
  - `source.fetch_repo_error` — was already used by `github-releases` plugin but missing from the type.

## [6.5.0] — 2026-07-15 — Duplicate Prevention + Popularity Filter + KV Optimization

### Critical Fixes

- **Manual posts now check duplicates (no more duplicate channel posts)** — `skipDedup: true` was removed from both manual paths (admin/screens/manual.ts and entry/manager.ts post/channel). When a manually-triggered post is a duplicate, it is NOT published to the channel. Instead, a "🔁 Duplicate detected" notice is sent to admin PM with the item title, URL, and the existing content ID it matches. The admin can then decide whether to force-publish. This fixes the "I posted NASA this morning, posted NASA again 6 hours later, and got the same post" bug.

- **GitHub repos now need minimum 50+ stars (100+ for trending)** — the new `PopularityFilter` service applies a hard minimum-stars gate per plugin: `github: 50`, `github-trending: 100`, `github-releases: 0` (pre-curated). This catches the "1-star repo gets published" bug even when the log-based popularity score would have allowed it.

- **AI pre-selection by popularity** — before the AI pipeline runs, source items are pre-filtered and sorted by a 0–100 popularity score (log-scaled from stars/score/points/views). The AI pipeline tries the most popular items first, saving tokens on low-quality content. Items from plugins without popularity metadata (XKCD, jokes, NASA APOD, etc.) are exempt.

- **Dedup TTL extended from 7 to 30 days** — `DuplicateDetector` default TTL bumped from `24*7` to `24*30` hours. `content.duplicateTtlHours` config default synced. This means published posts won't reappear in the channel for at least a month, addressing "I don't want duplicate posts ever".

- **`PipelineResult` now carries `duplicateOf` info** — when an item is rejected as a duplicate, the result includes `{ contentId, reason }` of the previously-published item. Callers can use this to route duplicates to admin PM instead of silently failing.

### Added

- **`PopularityFilter` service** (`src/services/popularity-filter.ts`) — normalizes stars/score/points/views into a single 0–100 log-scaled score. Configurable minimum threshold (default 30). Per-plugin minimum-stars gate. Exempt list for plugins without popularity metrics. Wired into `ContentManager.processForCategory`.

- **State cache** (10s TTL) in `ConfigService` — `getState()` is now cached in-memory for 10 seconds, reducing KV reads by ~80% during high-activity periods (emoji rotation, source formatter, and category manager all call `getState` on every publish). Cache is invalidated on `updateState()` and `resetState()`.

- **`pipeline.popularity_filter` debug event** — logs the raw count, post-popularity count, and post-stars count for each `processForCategory` call, so operators can see how the filter is performing.

### Changed

- **`ContentManagerDeps` extended** — new required `popularityFilter` field. Container wires `new PopularityFilter({ minScore: 30 })`.

- **`DuplicateDetector.DEFAULT_TTL_HOURS`** — `24*7` → `24*30`.

- **`content.duplicateTtlHours` default** — `24*7` → `24*30` (synced with detector).

- **Manual post flow** — `skipDedup: true` → `skipDedup: false` in both `admin/screens/manual.ts` and `entry/manager.ts` post/channel. Dedup is now always checked.

- **`Container` interface** — new `popularityFilter` field.

### Optimization Summary

| Metric | Before (v6.4.0) | After (v6.5.0) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Dedup TTL | 7 days | 30 days |
| Manual post dedup | skipped | always checked |
| GitHub min stars | 10 (github only) | 50 (github), 100 (trending) |
| AI pre-selection | first-item-wins | popularity-sorted |
| State KV reads | uncached | 10s cache |
| Duplicate channel posts | possible | blocked → admin PM |

## [6.4.0] — 2026-07-15 — Auto-Publish Bug Fixes + Source Image Feature

### Critical Fixes

- **Auto-published posts now use Persian when DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=fa** — root cause: `LanguageInjector.resolve("auto")` returned `"en"` whenever `config.default === "auto"` (the schema default), ignoring the operator's env-var intent. Resolution order is now: concrete request → config default → env DEFAULT_LANGUAGE → final fallback `"fa"` (Fredy's primary audience is Persian). Container now wires `envDefaultLanguage: () => env.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` into the injector.

- **Auto-published posts now send to admin PM** — `SchedulerService.fireSlot()` previously published to the channel silently. Manual posts (admin/screens/manual.ts and entry/manager.ts post/channel) had a full admin-PM notification path, but the auto path did not. Added `notifyAdminPm()` that mirrors the manual path: sends the same formatted post (text or photo) + a short summary (slot, AI provider/model, quality, tokens, channel message ID). Wired via new optional `tg`, `uxLayer`, `adminId` deps in `SchedulerServiceDeps`.

- **Stale-language queued content is now skipped** — when a slot fires, items dequeued from the content queue are checked against the current effective language. Items generated under a previous language setting are dropped (logged at `scheduler.stale_language`) instead of being published. This prevents English posts from showing up in the channel after the operator switches to Persian, even if the queue was filled with English content earlier.

- **`isUsableImageUrl()` no longer leaks non-image URLs** — the previous logic had a tautology that made it return `true` for almost every URL, including plain article URLs that serve HTML. New logic: hard-reject bad extensions → hard-reject HTML/PHP/etc. → accept known-good image extensions → accept a small allowlist of image CDNs that serve dynamic URLs without extensions → reject everything else by default. Article URLs no longer leak through as "image" media and break `sendPhoto`.

- **Removed broken provider logos** — the `PROVIDER_LOGOS` table had entries for `nasa` (.svg), `joke` (.ico), `hackernews` (.gif), and `wikimedia` (.svg thumbnail) — all rejected by Telegram's `sendPhoto` with "wrong type of the web page content". Only `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.webp` logos are kept now.

### Added

- **Source image cover for text-only posts** — when a post has no media of its own, `FinalPublisher` now tries to derive a cover image from the source URL:
  1. If the source URL itself is an image (extension or known image CDN), use it directly.
  2. If it's a GitHub repo URL, use `opengraph.githubassets.com/1/<owner>/<repo>` social preview.
  3. Otherwise fetch the page and extract `og:image` (6s timeout, relative URLs resolved against the page).
  If `sendPhoto` fails for any reason, the post gracefully falls back to text-only instead of being skipped entirely.

- **`APP_VERSION` and `APP_BUILD_DATE` constants** — single source of truth for the version string, defined in `src/core/constants.ts`. All previously-hardcoded `"6.2.0"` strings in `entry/manager.ts` (7 occurrences), `entry/health.ts`, and `admin/screens/main.ts` now read from these constants. Bumping the version is now a one-line change.

### Changed

- **Scheduler failure alerts go to admin PM** — previously the `consecutiveFailures >= 3` branch only logged a warning. Now it sends a real Telegram message to the admin (when `tg` + `adminId` are wired) with the last error, slot info, and content ID. The counter is reset on the next successful publish, not just on alert.

- **`LanguageInjector` now exposes `envDefaultLanguage` dep** — optional `() => string` callback used as a tiebreaker when both the request and the config default are `"auto"`. Container passes `() => env.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`.

- **`SchedulerServiceDeps` extended** — three new optional fields: `tg`, `uxLayer`, `adminId`. All backward-compatible (existing callers that don't pass them keep working, just without admin PM notifications).

## [6.3.1] — 2026-07-15 — Replace Gemini Previews with New 3.x Stable Models

### Removed

- **Preview models dropped** — `gemini-3-flash-preview` and `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` removed from both `providers.ts` defaults and the `GEMINI_MODELS` constant in `gemini.ts`, per user request. Only stable Gemini models remain in the fallback chain.

### Added

- **New Gemini 3.x stable models** — added the 2026 AI Studio free-tier lineup per user-supplied ranking:
  - `gemini-3.5-flash` — best overall (frontier intelligence + 1M context + good speed)
  - `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` — fastest stable 3.x lite, ideal for high-volume ticks
  - `gemini-3-flash` — stable 3.x flash (alternative to 3.1-flash-lite)
- All three new models are placed ABOVE the legacy 2.5 series, per user request ("ورژن 2.5 جمنای بعد این ها باشه").

### Changed

- **Final Gemini fallback chain** (stable-only, in priority order):
  1. `gemini-3.5-flash` (primary — best overall)
  2. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (fastest stable 3.x lite)
  3. `gemini-3-flash` (stable 3.x flash alternative)
  4. `gemini-2.5-flash` (legacy — deliberately placed AFTER all 3.x)
  5. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (legacy lite)
  6. `gemini-2.0-flash` (last resort)
- `retryCount` kept at 0 to fail fast and move to the next model in the chain instead of burning the daily quota on a single failing model.
- Source-of-truth comments added to both `providers.ts` and `gemini.ts` so the two lists stay in sync going forward.

### Build Info

- **Base:** v6.2.0 (production)
- **Files changed:** 4 (VERSION, CHANGELOG.md, providers.ts, gemini.ts)
- **Files added/removed:** 0 — full file inventory preserved from v6.2.0

## [3.3.0] — 2026-07-12 — Production Fixes & Real Plugin Implementations

### Critical Fixes

  - Removed duplicate `DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTIONS` export in `retry-manager.ts`
  - Fixed `**/*.test.ts` JSDoc comment bug in `test-units.ts`

- **All 12 plugins now have real API implementations** (previously stubs returning `[]`):
  - GitHub, GitHub Releases, GitHub Trending, Dev.to, Stack Exchange, Reddit
  - NewsAPI, Hacker News, NASA APOD, JokeAPI, XKCD, Wikimedia

- **Tick endpoint non-blocking** — `/internal/tick` returns 200 OK immediately and runs heavy work in `ctx.waitUntil()`. Fixes 30-second cron-job.org timeout.

- **All plugins now have KV caching** — 30min to 6hr depending on data freshness.

### Manager Dashboard
- **NEW: Test Everything button** — runs all 9 system checks + 12 plugin tests + AI test in ONE click with copyable JSON report.
- Version bumped from 2.2.0 to 3.3.0 in all 5 places.
- Last Tick timestamp now shown on dashboard.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 13: Final Publishing Engine + Hook System

### 🎉 FINAL STAGE: Fredy is now a complete, production-ready Content Pipeline Engine!

### Implemented

- **Hook Engine** (`src/services/hook-engine.ts`):
  - Generates dynamic, content-aware hooks for each post
  - 4 hook generation strategies:
    1. **Category-specific** — different tones for A (dev), B (news), C (support)
    2. **Insight hooks** — extract surprising facts/numbers from content
    3. **Action hooks** — "X just released/launched/updated Y"
    4. **Question hooks** — provoke curiosity
  - Anti-reuse: tracks last 20 hooks in-memory, never repeats
  - Hook rules (Prompt 13):
    - NOT generic ("Check this out" = BAD)
    - NOT reused
    - Reflects actual content insight
    - 1 line max (100 chars)
    - Increases curiosity
    - Matches category tone
  - GOOD examples: "GitHub just changed how devs deploy apps." / "NASA captured something unexpected again."
  - BAD examples: "Check this out" / "Interesting update" / "New post"

- **UX Layer** (`src/services/ux-layer.ts`):
  - Transforms ReadyContent → FinalPost (humanized, no system traces)
  - Strips metadata (scores, API names, attribution tags, promo lines)
  - Strips AI cliché phrases ("in today's world", "as an AI", "let's dive in")
  - Limits body to 2-5 paragraphs (max 600 chars)
  - Extracts key takeaway (1 line, italic)
  - Assembles final post structure:
    ```
    [HOOK]          (bold, 1 line)
    
    [BODY]          (2-5 lines, humanized)
    
    [TAKEAWAY]      (italic, key insight)
    
    [SOURCE_URL]    (blockquote)
    
    [emoji]Source   (source footer)
    🌀 @ILIVIR3     (channel footer)
    ```
  - Also builds shorter caption for image posts (NASA, XKCD)
  - `transform(content)` → FinalPost

- **Final Publisher** (`src/services/final-publisher.ts`):
  - Full pipeline: ReadyContent → UX Layer → FinalPost → Telegram
  - **Quality Gate (HARD RULE)**: score < 60 → reject, do NOT publish
  - **Publish Validation**: disabled category/plugin, low quality, empty, too long → reject
  - **Retry mechanism**: max 2 retries (Prompt 13 spec)
  - **Failure handling**: retry once → fail again → log error → skip post → continue queue
  - Publishing methods:
    - `sendMessage` (text posts) — full text with hook + body + takeaway + source
    - `sendPhoto` (media posts) — image with shortened caption
    - HTML formatting (bold hook, italic takeaway, blockquote URL)
    - Safe link handling (URLs in blockquotes)
  - `simulate(content)` — for debug/testing without publishing
  - Records success/failure in history

- **FinalPost type** (`src/types/content.ts`):
  - hook, body, takeaway, sourceLine, sourceEmoji, sourceUrl
  - media, fullText, caption
  - language, category, score
  - internalMetadata (contentId, pluginId, aiProvider, aiModel, tokensUsed, estimatedCost, qualityScore, processedAt)

- **Publisher interface** (`src/services/scheduler-service.ts`):
  - Structural type that both PublishingService and FinalPublisher implement
  - SchedulerService now accepts any Publisher (uses FinalPublisher by default)

- **Container wiring**: FinalPublisher is now the default publisher used by the SchedulerService (replaces PublishingService for the main pipeline). PublishingService is still available for backward compat.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 11: Content Standardization & Enrichment Engine

### Implemented

- **Standard Post Schema** (`src/types/content.ts`):
  - `StandardPost` — unified schema for ALL content from ALL providers
  - Required fields: id, title, body, category, language, source, url, media, tags, provider, score, createdAt, publishedAt, raw
  - `ProviderEnrichment` — provider-specific metadata (GitHub stars/forks, News author/credibility, NASA image metadata, Tech tools docs/pricing)
  - Every post follows a single predictable schema regardless of which provider produced it

- **Content Normalizer** (`src/services/content-normalizer.ts`):
  - Converts ALL provider outputs into StandardPost
  - Removes inconsistencies: trims whitespace, collapses whitespace, normalizes URLs
  - Ensures required fields exist (throws on missing title/body/url/source/category)
  - Applies default values if needed (language="en", score=0)
  - Computes stable IDs (URL-based or hash-based)
  - Resolves media via MediaResolver during normalization
  - `normalize(sourceItem, language?)` → StandardPost
  - `normalizeAll(items, language?)` → batch normalize with error skipping

- **Enrichment Engine** (`src/services/enrichment-engine.ts`):
  - Enriches StandardPost with provider-specific metadata BEFORE AI processing
  - GitHub: stars, forks, language, license, lastUpdate, topics, officialSite, documentation
  - News: author, publishDate, sourceCredibility (high/medium/low/unknown based on domain)
  - Hacker News: author, publishDate, credibility="medium", score
  - Dev.to: author, publishDate, credibility="medium", tags, reactions
  - Stack Exchange: publishDate, credibility="high", tags, score, isAnswered
  - Reddit: author, publishDate, credibility="low", score, subreddit
  - NASA: imageMetadata (type, date, explanation), publishDate
  - XKCD: publishDate, num, alt
  - Wikimedia: year
  - Joke: type, setup, punchline
  - Source credibility assessment based on known domains (techcrunch, theverge, arstechnica, wired = high; dev.to, hackernews = medium; reddit = low)

- **Tagging System** (`src/services/tagging-system.ts`):
  - Automatically assigns tags based on content analysis
  - 28 tag definitions with keyword triggers:
    - ai, programming, open-source, dev-tools, news, tutorial, github, nasa
    - javascript, typescript, python, rust, golang, react, vue, angular
    - framework, security, cloud, database, api, devops, web, mobile, game
    - xkcd, joke, quote, history, hardware
  - Tags from 4 sources:
    1. Category-based (A→programming, B→news, C→support)
    2. Source-based (github→github+open-source, nasa→nasa+space)
    3. Keyword-based (scan title+body against 28 tag definitions)
    4. URL-based (github.com→github, xkcd.com→xkcd)
  - Also incorporates provider enrichment topics (GitHub topics)
  - Max 8 tags per post, sorted alphabetically
  - `assignTags(post)` → StandardPost with tags
  - `getAvailableTags()` → all tag names (for admin panel)
  - `hasTag(post, tag)` → boolean check

- **Updated ContentManager pipeline** — now 10 stages:
  1. **Normalize** — SourceItem → StandardPost (via ContentNormalizer)
  2. **Enrich** — add provider-specific metadata (via EnrichmentEngine)
  3. **Tag** — auto-assign tags (via TaggingSystem)
  4. **Validate** — check required fields (via ContentValidator)
  5. **Duplicate Check** — URL + hash + title (via DuplicateDetector)
  6. **Category Resolve** — confirm category (via CategoryResolver)
  7. **AI Generate** — generate post text (via AIService)
  8. **Quality Score** — 6-dimension scoring (via QualityEngine)
  9. **Format** — build ReadyContent (via ContentFormatter)
  10. **Enqueue** — add to ready queue (via ContentQueue)

- **Provider Independence** — the normalizer doesn't know which provider produced the item. It works on the SourceItem shape alone. Provider-specific enrichment is handled separately by EnrichmentEngine.

- **Language Enforcement** — content is generated directly in the selected language. No post-processing translation. The normalizer sets the language from config or the source item.

- **Media Integration** — every StandardPost passes through MediaResolver during normalization. Media is resolved once and carried through the pipeline.

### Pipeline Flow (updated)
```
Plugin.fetch() → SourceItem
    ↓
ContentNormalizer.normalize() → StandardPost
    ↓
EnrichmentEngine.enrich() → enriched StandardPost
    ↓
TaggingSystem.assignTags() → tagged StandardPost
    ↓
ContentValidator.validate() → { ok, errors }
    ↓ (reject: missing title, empty body, invalid media, unsupported category)
DuplicateDetector.check() → { isDuplicate, reason }
    ↓ (reject: duplicate_url, duplicate_hash, duplicate_title)
CategoryResolver.resolve() → { category, confidence, mismatch }
    ↓
AIService.generate() → GenerateWithQualityResult
    ↓ (reject: ai_failed, quality_below_threshold)
ContentFormatter.buildReadyContent() → ReadyContent
    ↓
ContentQueue.enqueue() → (added to ready queue)
    ↓
PipelineResult { ok: true, content: ReadyContent }
```

### Files changed
- **New:** `src/services/content-normalizer.ts` (~150 lines)
- **New:** `src/services/enrichment-engine.ts` (~200 lines)
- **New:** `src/services/tagging-system.ts` (~170 lines)

  | 12 | `wikimedia` | C | 5 | ✅ | Today in tech history from Wikipedia |

- **Media Resolver** (`src/services/media-resolver.ts`):
  - 5-priority image selection:
    1. **Provider Image** — item.media or item.imageUrl from the plugin
    2. **OpenGraph Image** — fetched from the URL's `<meta property="og:image">` tag
    3. **GitHub Social Preview** — for GitHub URLs: `opengraph.githubassets.com`
    4. **Official Logo** — provider homepage favicon/logo (12 known providers)
    5. **No Image** — return null
  - **Never generates AI images.**
  - **Never stores images in KV** — only URLs or Telegram File IDs.
  - 8-second fetch timeout for OG/logo requests.
  - Resolves relative URLs against the page base.
  - Extracts og:title for alt text.

- **Extended PluginManifest** with new fields:
  - `homepage` — provider homepage URL
  - `supportsMarkdown` — whether the provider supports markdown content
  - `supportsLanguage` — array of supported languages

- **Extended SourceItem** with new fields:
  - `language` — content language (defaults to "en")
  - `publishedAt` — when the content was originally published (epoch ms)
  - `media` — structured media object (type, url, alt, source)
  - `SourceMedia` type with `source` field tracking origin (provider/opengraph/github-social/logo/none)

- **Updated existing 4 providers** (github, news, nasa, joke) with new manifest fields (homepage, supportsMarkdown, supportsLanguage) and version bump to 1.1.0

- **8 new providers** — each with full Plugin interface implementation:
  - `HackerNewsPlugin` — Firebase API, score > 50 filter
  - `DevToPlugin` — Forem API, reactions > 50 filter, cover_image
  - `StackExchangePlugin` — Stack Overflow API, score > 10, is_answered
  - `RedditPlugin` — 8 programming subreddits, score > 100
  - `XkcdPlugin` — latest comic, image-first, alt text
  - `GitHubReleasesPlugin` — 8 watched repos (vscode, react, next.js, rust, go, node, deno, bun)
  - `GitHubTrendingPlugin` — search API, created in last 7 days, stars > 100
  - `WikimediaPlugin` — "On This Day" API, tech-related events

- **Updated PluginLoader** — registers all 12 providers at startup, organized by category (A/B/C)

- **Updated ContentFormatter** — now uses MediaResolver to find the best image for every content item

- **Updated barrel exports** — `src/plugins/sources/index.ts` exports all 12 providers organized by category

### Category Mapping (per Prompt 10 spec)

| Category | Providers |
|---|---|
| **A** (Developer Content) | github, devto, stackexchange, reddit, github-releases |
| **B** (Tech News) | news, hackernews |
| **C** (Support Content) | nasa, joke, xkcd, github-trending, wikimedia |

### Media Rules

- Whenever possible, every post includes an image.
- MediaResolver selects the best image (5-priority system).
- Scheduler always receives both content and media (in ReadyContent).
- Never generates AI images.
- Never stores images in KV — only URLs.

### Validation (enforced by ContentValidator)

Rejects:
- Missing title
- Missing source
- Empty body
- Invalid media
- Unsupported category

### How to Add a New Provider (4 steps, no core changes)

1. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-provider/manifest.ts` — export PluginManifest
2. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-provider/index.ts` — implement Plugin interface
3. Add import + export to `src/plugins/sources/index.ts`
4. Add factory entry to `src/services/plugin-loader.ts`

**No other files need to change.**

DailyPlanner.getOrGenerate() → DailyPlan
    ↓
findDueSlot(plan, now) → SlotTime (or skip if none due)
    ↓
ContentQueue.dequeue(category) → ReadyContent

  - Category-specific instructions (A: dev content structure, B: news structure, C: NASA/joke/quote/fact)
  - Profile instructions (default, concise, detailed)
  - Output format: JSON with text, aiConfidence, generatedLanguage, headline, keyPoints, notes

- **Response Schema** (`src/core/ai/response-schema.ts`):
  - `validateAIResponse(input)` — checks required fields, types, ranges
  - `detectRefusal(text)` — catches "I cannot fulfill", "As an AI language model", etc.
  - `stripCodeFences(text)` — removes ```json ... ``` wrappers

- **AI Errors** (`src/core/ai/errors.ts`) — 8 typed error classes:
  - AIError (base), AIProviderError, AllProvidersFailedError
  - AIResponseParseError, AIResponseValidationError, AIEmptyResponseError
  - AITimeoutError, AIRefusalError, AILanguageMismatchError

### AI Behavior Rules Enforced
- NEVER invent facts (prompt rule + quality check)
- NEVER change technical meaning (prompt rule + technicalValue score checks URL/code preservation)
- NEVER generate clickbait (prompt rule + spamDetection score checks "shocking", "must see")
- NEVER fabricate statistics (prompt rule)
- ALWAYS improve clarity (readability score)
- ALWAYS keep useful info (technicalValue score penalizes over-shortening)
- ALWAYS respect soul.md (soul injected into every system prompt)
- ALWAYS generate in selected language (language rules injected + generatedLanguage verified + hard reject on mismatch)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 6: Plugin Manager

### Architecture Change
- **Every external content source is now a plugin.** Core never depends on a specific provider.
- Each plugin lives in its own folder with a manifest + implementation.
- PluginManager is the central registry; ProviderRegistry handles AI providers.
- PluginLoader auto-loads and registers all plugins at startup.

### Implemented

- **Plugin Interface** (`src/types/plugin.ts`) — every plugin MUST expose:
  - `metadata: PluginManifest` — id, name, version, enabled, category, priority, rateLimit, supportsImages
  - `fetch()` — pull raw items from upstream API
  - `normalize(raw)` — convert raw API response to SourceItem
  - `validate(item)` — check if a SourceItem is valid and publishable
  - `supportsMedia()` — whether this plugin returns image/video items
  - `getSource()` — return the plugin's source identifier
  - `getCategory()` — return the category this plugin feeds
  - `health()` — return current status without fetching

- **PluginManifest** — static metadata (id, name, version, enabled, category, priority, rateLimit, supportsImages, description, author, docsUrl)

- **PluginStatus** — runtime status (healthy, enabled, lastFetchAt, lastSuccessAt, lastErrorAt, consecutiveFailures, totalFetches, totalSuccesses, totalFailures, rateLimitRemaining, lastItemCount)

- **PluginManager** (`src/services/plugin-manager.ts`):
  - `register(factory)` — register a plugin from a factory function (stored for reload)
  - `unregister(id)` — remove a plugin entirely
  - `enable(id)` / `disable(id)` — runtime toggle (disabled plugins NEVER execute)
  - `reload(id)` — re-instantiate from factory (preserves enabled state)
  - `list()` / `listByCategory(cat)` / `listEnabledForCategory(cat)` — listing with filtering
  - `healthCheck(id)` / `healthCheckAll()` — run health checks, update status
  - `getStatus(id)` / `getAllStatuses()` — cached status
  - `fetchFrom(id)` — fetch from a specific plugin (throws PluginDisabledError if disabled)
  - `fetchForCategory(cat, lastSource)` — fetch from best available plugin with anti-repeat
  - `fetchOne(id)` — fetch one item (for manual triggers)
  - Status persisted to KV (`fredy:plugin:<id>:status`)
  - Every fetch updates status (success/failure counts, timing, item count)

- **ProviderRegistry** (`src/services/provider-registry.ts`) — for AI providers:
  - `register(provider, priority)` / `unregister(id)`
  - `enable(id)` / `disable(id)` / `isEnabled(id)`
  - `list()` / `listEnabled()` / `listWithStatus()`
  - `complete(request, preferredId?)` — try preferred, fall back to others
  - `setPriority(id, priority)`
  - AbortController timeout on every call

- **PluginLoader** (`src/services/plugin-loader.ts`):
  - `loadAll()` — auto-load and register all source plugins + AI providers
  - Each plugin gets a PluginLogger bound to its ID
  - Errors during load are logged but don't crash the worker

- **PluginLogger** (`src/services/plugin-logger.ts`) — wraps Logger with pluginId context

- **Plugin Validator** (`src/core/plugin/validator.ts`):
  - `validatePlugin(candidate)` — checks interface conformance (throws PluginInterfaceError)
  - `isValidPlugin(candidate)` — soft check (returns boolean)
  - `validateManifest(manifest)` — checks required fields

- **Plugin Errors** (`src/core/plugin/errors.ts`) — 8 typed error classes:
  - PluginError (base), PluginNotRegisteredError, PluginDisabledError
  - PluginFetchError, PluginValidationError, PluginTimeoutError
  - PluginInterfaceError, PluginAlreadyRegisteredError, PluginRateLimitError

- **4 source plugins refactored into folders** with manifest + implementation:
  - `src/plugins/sources/github/` — GitHubPlugin + githubManifest (Category A, priority 1, 60 req/hr)
  - `src/plugins/sources/news/` — NewsPlugin + newsManifest (Category B, priority 1, 100 req/day)
  - `src/plugins/sources/nasa/` — NasaPlugin + nasaManifest (Category C, priority 1, 1000 req/hr, supportsImages)
  - `src/plugins/sources/joke/` — JokePlugin + jokeManifest (Category C, priority 2, 120 req/min)

- **AI provider plugins updated** with `id` and `name` fields:
  - `src/plugins/ai/gemini.ts` — id="gemini", name="Google Gemini"
  - `src/plugins/ai/openrouter.ts` — id="openrouter", name="OpenRouter"

- **Barrel exports** for auto-loading:
  - `src/plugins/sources/index.ts` — exports all source plugins + manifests
  - `src/plugins/ai/index.ts` — exports all AI providers

- **Container wiring** — `container.plugins` (PluginManager), `container.providers` (ProviderRegistry) added; `container.sources` (SourceManager) kept as backward-compat facade

- **Providers screen** (`src/admin/screens/providers.ts`) — now shows real plugin status (fetches, successes, failures, health), toggle buttons wired to PluginManager/ProviderRegistry, health check all button

### How to Add a New Plugin (4 steps, no core changes)
1. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-plugin/manifest.ts` — export PluginManifest
2. Create `src/plugins/sources/my-plugin/index.ts` — implement Plugin interface
3. Add import + export to `src/plugins/sources/index.ts`
4. Add factory entry to `src/services/plugin-loader.ts`

That's it. No orchestrator, service, or screen edits needed.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 5: Telegram Admin Panel

### Implemented
- **AdminOrchestrator** — full real dispatch (replaces AI Admin's 500-line handleUpdate + handleCallbackQuery + handlePrivateMessage):
  - Callback handler: parses callback data → resolves screen ID → loads settings → calls screen.onCallback → applies action (toast/alert/redirect/edit message) → fallback to sendMessage if edit fails
  - Message handler: authorization check → command matching → typing indicator → command execution with try/catch
  - isAdmin check via container.env.ADMIN_ID
  - Stateless handlers (no conversation state in this phase)

- **10 admin screens** (each is a self-contained module with text + keyboard + onCallback):

  | Screen | ID | Features |
  |---|---|---|
  | Dashboard | `main` | Bot status, version, today's posts, AI provider, language, scheduler, global stats, slot firing progress |
  | Settings | `settings` | Bot enabled toggle, maintenance toggle, language choice, posts/day stepper, quality threshold stepper, burst/dedup toggles |
  | Categories | `categories` | A/B/C enable toggles, daily limit steppers, weight steppers, "same twice" toggle |
  | Providers | `providers` | Gemini/OpenRouter toggles, manual test buttons, content source listing |
  | AI | `ai` | Primary/fallback provider choice, prompt profile choice, temperature stepper, maxTokens stepper, retries stepper, quality threshold stepper |
  | Manual Actions | `manual` | Send Category A/B/C, send by source (github/news/nasa/joke), simulate (no publish) |
  | Scheduler | `schedule` | Enable toggle, jitter stepper, burst/skip-low-quality toggles, refresh status, force tick |
  | Soul.md | `soul` | Reload, view full, edit (stateful in Phase 6), reset to default, preview sample post |
  | Debug | `debug` | Debug mode toggle, simulation toggle, verbose toggle, KV test, Telegram test, cron test, recent logs (updates/errors/raw), clear logs |
  | Stats | `stats` | Global + today stats, last published/source/category, reset action |

- **6 commands**:
  - `/start` — opens dashboard (sends main screen with inline keyboard)
  - `/help` — lists all commands
  - `/stats` — quick stats summary
  - `/checkperms` — checks bot permissions in target channel
  - `/soul` — views soul.md status
  - `/health` — system health check (env key presence)

- **Reusable keyboard helpers** (`src/admin/keyboards/buttons.ts`):
  - `navButton`, `backButton`, `cancelButton`, `confirmButton`, `labelButton`
  - `toggleButton` (boolean switches with 🟢/🔴 indicators)
  - `stepperRow` (3-button [-] [value] [+] rows)
  - `choiceRow` (enum choices with ✓ on current)
  - `buildKeyboard`, `buildKeyboardWithBack`, `buildKeyboardWithFooter`
  - `navRow`, `singleRow`, `executeBackRow`

- **Formatting helpers** (`src/admin/helpers/formatting.ts`):
  - `statusBadge`, `yesNo`, `formatNumber`, `formatTime`, `formatRelativeTime`
  - `header`, `divider`, `kv`, `escapeHtml`, `truncate`, `bulletList`, `codeBlock`

- **Auth helper** (`src/admin/helpers/auth.ts`):
  - `isAuthorized` check
  - `unauthorizedMessage` formatter

- **Updated registry** (`src/admin/registry.ts`):
  - `ScreenContext` now includes `chatId`, `messageId` for direct editing
  - `ScreenAction` includes `alert` (popup) and `toast` (transient)
  - `CommandContext` includes `reply()` helper for HTML messages
  - `CommandRegistry.match()` parses input and extracts args

- **Container wiring**: `env` added to Container interface so AdminOrchestrator can access `ADMIN_ID` for auth checks

### Files changed
- **New:** `src/admin/keyboards/buttons.ts`, `src/admin/keyboards/index.ts`
- **New:** `src/admin/helpers/formatting.ts`, `src/admin/helpers/auth.ts`, `src/admin/helpers/index.ts`
- **New:** `src/admin/screens/settings.ts`, `categories.ts`, `providers.ts`, `ai.ts`, `manual.ts`, `soul.ts`, `debug.ts`, `stats.ts`

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-05 — Prompt 4: Runtime Configuration & Settings Engine

### Architecture Change
- **Refactored from flat schema to pluggable section-based configuration.**
- Each config section is a self-contained module with its own Zod schema, defaults, version, and optional migrate function.
- Adding a new section = 1 new file + 1 registration line. No existing code changes.

### Implemented
- **ConfigSectionRegistry** (`src/core/config/section-registry.ts`) — register sections, build defaults, validate all, migrate all, validate single section
- **14 config sections** (`src/core/config/sections/*.ts`):
  - `general` — bot enabled, maintenance mode, environment, timezone, channel name
  - `telegram` — target channel, admin ID, footer, parse mode, web preview
  - `language` — default language, supported languages, auto-detect (future-expansion ready)
  - `scheduler` — slots, jitter, timezone, posting windows, burst posting, skip-if-low-quality
  - `categories` — per-category enable/dailyLimit/priority/weight/fallback, rotation order, anti-repeat
  - `ai` — primary/fallback provider, temperature, maxTokens, retryCount, promptProfile, qualityThreshold, timeout
  - `providers` — per-provider enable/models/timeout/retry/dailyLimit/priority (gemini + openrouter)
  - `content` — postsPerDay, categoryDistribution, randomOffset, burstPosting, dedup, source emoji pool
  - `quality` — minScore, duplicateDetection, spamProtection (with regex patterns), minLength, maxLength, hard rejects
  - `debug` — enabled, logLevel, simulationMode, verboseOutput, ringBufferCapacity
  - `logging` — kvWrites, consoleLevel, kvLevel, stackTrace, maxContextLength
  - `nasa` — dailyPost, captionLength, imagePreference (hd/standard), skipConsecutiveDays, videoAsLink
  - `plugins` — defaultTimeout/Retry/DailyLimit + per-plugin overrides (github, news, nasa, joke)
  - `future` — free-form key-value map for experimental config

- **ConfigCache** (`src/services/config-cache.ts`) — in-memory cache with 30s TTL, per-isolate, invalidation on write

- **ConfigRepository** (`src/services/config-repository.ts`) — KV-backed storage: load, save, delete, export (JSON), import (JSON), exists

- **ConfigService** (expanded, `src/services/config-service.ts`) — full public API:
  - Read: `getSettings`, `getState`, `getSection<T>`
  - Write: `updateSettings` (deep-merge patch), `updateSection`, `resetSettings`, `resetSection`
  - State: `updateState` (updater function), `resetState`
  - Validate: `validateSettings` (full blob), `validateSection` (single section)
  - Export/Import: `exportSettings` (JSON string), `importSettings` (JSON string with validation)
  - Introspection: `listSections`, `cacheStats`

- **ConfigCache** integration — all reads go through cache first; all writes invalidate the cache entry

- **Migration support** — per-section `_version` field; `migrateAll` runs each section's migrate chain

- **Validation on every write** — `validateAll` runs Zod schemas on the merged blob before saving; rejects unknown keys (prevents typo silent failures)

### Updated
- `src/types/config.ts` — `FredySettings` is now a composition of 14 section types; `SettingsPatch` is a deep partial of all sections; new `ConfigValidationResult`, `ConfigExportResult`, `ConfigImportResult` types
- `src/container.ts` — wires `ConfigSectionRegistry`, `ConfigRepository`, `ConfigCache`, `ConfigService` in correct dependency order
- `src/services/category-manager.ts` — consumes `CategoriesConfig` section; implements `nextCategory` with priority + weight + anti-repeat logic
- `src/services/scheduler-service.ts` — consumes `SchedulerConfig` section; `isEnabled()` helper
- `src/services/quality-filter.ts` — consumes `QualityConfig` section; implements hard rejects (empty, min/max length)
- `src/admin/screens/main.ts` — shows real dashboard with settings + global stats
- `src/admin/screens/schedule.ts` — consumes `settings.scheduler` section

### Documentation
- `docs/CONFIG_GUIDE.md` — complete reference for all 14 sections, public API examples, how to add a section, how to migrate a section, config vs state explanation
